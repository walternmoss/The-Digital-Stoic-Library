# The-Digital-Stoic-Library
This repository features a comprehensive pipeline for creating a digital philological edition of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. It includes Python scripts for API data acquisition, Gemini 3 Pro-powered translation, and CLTK-based lexical tagging. The final output is an interactive, web-based library with dynamic lemma-highlighting readers.
