    "english": "Arrian to Lucius Gellius, greetings. I did not compose these discourses of Epictetus as one usually composes books, nor did I release them to the public myself—indeed, I claim I did not 'write' them at all. Rather, whatever I heard him say, I tried to transcribe using his very words as best I could, to preserve for myself a memorial of his way of thinking and his frankness of speech. These are, as you might expect, the sort of things a man speaks spontaneously to another, not what one would draft for later publication. I do not know how they fell into men's hands without my consent or knowledge. Yet, I care little if I appear a poor writer, and Epictetus cares not at all if someone looks down on his words; for when he spoke, he clearly aimed at nothing other than moving the minds of his listeners toward the best things. If these transcripts achieve that same end, let it be so. If not, let the reader understand this: when he himself spoke these words, it was inevitable that the listener felt exactly what Epictetus intended him to feel. If the words by themselves do not achieve this, perhaps I am to blame, or perhaps it must be so. Farewell. [Chapter 1] Concerning things that are in our power and things that are not. Of all the other faculties, you will find not one that is capable of contemplating itself, and therefore not one capable of approving or disapproving of itself. [Consider] the gram...",
    "notes": "This opening passage serves as a vital framing device for the entire Stoic curriculum. Arrian emphasizes that these are not theoretical essays but 'hypomnemata'—rough notes of a medical clinic for the soul. The mention of 'parrhesia' (frank speech) signals that the instruction will be direct, unvarnished, and aimed at moral reformation rather than intellectual entertainment. Epictetus's sole purpose was 'psychagogy'—guiding the mind toward the Good. Arrian warns that the written word is lifeless compared to the 'living voice' of the teacher, which compels the student to confront their own conscience. The text then immediately pivots to the First Principle of Stoicism: the dichotomy of control. By introducing the 'faculties,' Epictetus prepares the student to identify the only faculty capable of self-examination: the 'Prohairesis' (moral choice/volition). Other skills, like grammar (hinted at the cutoff), operate on external objects but cannot judge their own value; only the rational faculty can judge both itself and everything else.",

    "english": "Concerning things that are within our power and things that are not. Look at your various faculties; you will find not one that is capable of contemplating itself, and consequently, not one capable of approving or disapproving of itself. How far does grammar possess this contemplative power? Only enough to distinguish letters. And music? Only enough to distinguish melodies. Do any of these contemplate themselves? Not at all. If you write to a friend, grammar will tell you how to form the words; but whether you should write to your friend or not, grammar will not tell you. And so it is with music regarding melodies; whether it is time to sing and play the lyre, or not to sing and play, it will not tell you. Who then will tell you? That faculty which contemplates both itself and all other things. And what is this faculty? The Rational Faculty; for this is the only one we have received that can examine itself—what it is, what it is capable of, and how valuable it is—and examine all the others as well. For what else is it that tells us gold is beautiful? The gold does not say so itself. Clearly, it is the faculty that makes use of impressions. What else distinguishes music, grammar, and the other faculties, testing their uses and pointing out the proper seasons for their application? Nothing else. Thus, the gods, as was fitting, have placed in our power only the best and most governing faculty of all: the right use of impressions; but everything else they have not placed in our power. Was it because they did not wish to? I believe that if they could have, they would have entrusted those things to us as well; but they simply could not. For being on earth, and bound to such a body and to such companions, how was it possible for us not to be hindered in these external things by external factors? But what does Zeus say? 'Epictetus, if it were possible, I would have made your little body and your little property free and unhindered. But now, do not let it escape you: this body is not yours, but only finely kneaded clay. Since I could not make the body free, I have given you a portion of myself: this power of impulse and repulsion, of desire and aversion, and simply the power to make use of impressions. If you take care of this and place all that is your own within it, you will never be hindered, never impeded; you will not groan, you will not blame, you will not flatter anyone.' What then? Does this seem small to you? Heaven forbid. Are you content with it? I pray so. But now, although we have the power to care for one thing and apply ourselves to one thing, we prefer to care for many things and be bound to many things: to the body, to property, to brother, to friend, to child, and to slave. Because we are bound to many things, we are weighed down and dragged by them. That is why, if the weather prevents sailing, we sit distracted and keep peering out: 'Which wind is blowing?' 'The North wind.' 'When will the West wind blow?' 'When it chooses, my friend, or when Aeolus chooses; for God has not made you the master of the winds, but Aeolus.' What then must we do? We must make the best of what is in our power, and treat the rest according to its nature. And what is its nature? However God pleases. 'Must I then be the only one beheaded now?' Why? Would you have all men beheaded for your consolation? Will you not stretch out your neck as Lateranus did at Rome when condemned by Nero? For when he stretched out his neck and received a weak blow, he shrank back for a moment, but then stretched it out again. And even before this, when Epaphroditus, Nero's freedman, approached him and asked about the offense, he replied, 'If I want to say anything, I will say it to your master.' What then should we have ready at hand in such circumstances? Why, this: 'I must die.' Must I then die groaning? 'I must be chained.' Must I then be chained lamenting? 'I must be exiled.' Does anyone hinder me from going into exile smiling, cheerful, and content? 'Tell me your secrets.' 'I will not, for that is in my power.' 'But I will chain you.' 'Man, what are you saying? Chain me? You may chain my leg, but my will—not even Zeus himself can conquer that.' 'I will throw you in prison.' 'My poor little body, you mean.' 'I will behead you.' 'Did I ever tell you that I possessed the only neck that cannot be severed?' These are the thoughts that those who pursue philosophy should ponder; these are the lessons they should write down daily; in these, they should exercise themselves. Thrasea used to say, 'I would rather be killed today than exiled tomorrow.' What then did Rufus say to him? 'If you choose death as the heavier misfortune, what sort of foolish choice is that? If as the lighter, who has given you the choice? Will you not be content with what is given?' For this reason, what did Agrippinus say? 'I do not stand in my own way.' When news was brought to him: 'You are condemned in the Senate.' 'To good luck?' he asked. 'But the fifth hour has arrived'—this was the time when he exercised and bathed—'let us go and exercise.' Later, someone said to him, 'You are condemned.' 'To exile,' he asked, 'or to death?' 'To exile.' 'What of my property?' 'It is not confiscated.' 'Then let us go to Aricia and eat our lunch.' This is what it means to have practiced what one ought to practice: to have made desire and aversion free from hindrance and free from chance. 'I must die.' If instantly, then I die instantly. If in a short while, I dine now, for the hour has come, and later I will die. How? As befits one who restores what is not his own.",
    "notes": "This discourse, known as 'On things in our power and not in our power,' serves as the foundational axiom of Epictetus' entire philosophy. The central lesson is the strict delineation of the 'Dichotomy of Control.' Epictetus identifies the 'Rational Faculty' (logic/reason) as the only faculty capable of self-reflection; all other skills (grammar, music) are instrumental and cannot judge their own worth. The practical core of the lesson is contained in the 'Speech of Zeus,' where the body is dismissed as 'finely kneaded clay' (pelos)—mere matter subject to external laws and not truly ours. Our only true possession is the 'use of impressions' (chresis phantasion). Suffering arises solely from misidentifying what is ours; when we attach our well-being to externals (body, property, relatives), we become slaves to chance and other men. The examples of Lateranus and Agrippinus illustrate the ultimate goal of Stoic training (askesis): to face death, exile, or physical restraint with total indifference, viewing them not as evils, but as external events to be navigated with a composed will. Freedom is defined here not as changing the world, but as aligning one's will so that nothing can happen contrary to it.",

    "english": "How is one to preserve their true character in every situation? Listen closely. For the rational animal, only the irrational is intolerable; the rational is bearable. Blows are not naturally intolerable. How is this so? Look at the Lacedaemonians: they endure whipping because they have learned it is rational and consistent with their laws. But to hang oneself? That is not rational, and if a man feels coerced to do it, he suffers more from the irrationality of the act than the pain. The determination of what is reasonable or unreasonable applies not only to external things but depends heavily on one's own specific character. For one man, it is reasonable to hold a chamber pot for another to avoid starvation; for another, it is intolerable not only to hold it but even to watch another do it. If you ask me, 'Should I hold the pot?' I will tell you that eating is better than starving. But if you ask, 'Is this worthy of me?' that is a question only you can answer, for you know your own value. Consider Agrippinus. When Florus asked if he should attend Nero's shows to perform, Agrippinus said, 'Go.' When Florus asked, 'Why do you not go?' Agrippinus replied, 'Because I do not even deliberate on the matter.' For he who once weighs the value of external things against his own character has already lost his way. Why do you ask me whether death or life is preferable? I say life. Pain or pleasure? I say pleasure. But if you say, 'If I do not act in this tragedy, I will be beheaded,' then I say: Go and act, but I will not. Why? Because you consider yourself merely one thread in the tunic, indistinguishable from the others. But I? I wish to be the purple stripe—that small, brilliant part that gives luster to the rest. Do not ask me to be like the multitude, for then I am no longer the purple. Priscus Helvidius saw this clearly. When Vespasian sent word forbidding him to enter the Senate, Priscus replied, 'It is in your power not to allow me to be a senator, but as long as I am one, I must enter.' Vespasian said, 'Enter, but be silent.' Priscus answered, 'Do not ask for my opinion and I will be silent.' 'But I must ask,' said Caesar. 'And I must say what appears just to me.' 'Then I will kill you.' 'Did I ever tell you I was immortal? You do your part, and I will do mine. It is yours to kill, mine to die without trembling; yours to banish, mine to leave without grieving.' What good did Priscus do, being but one man? What good does the purple stripe do for the cloak? It stands out and sets a standard of beauty. Another man in such a crisis would have thanked Caesar for sparing him; such a man Caesar would not have banned, knowing he would sit there like an earthen vessel. Consider the athlete who, facing the risk of death unless his genitals were amputated, chose death when his philosopher brother asked what he would do. He refused to live as anything less than the athlete he was. This is the power of character. Someone asks, 'How do we perceive our own character?' How does the bull, when the lion attacks, know his own strength and rush forward to protect the herd? It is clear that with the possession of power comes the consciousness of it. But such power does not come suddenly. One must train through the winter and prepare, not rushing blindly at things beyond one's strength. Consider at what price you sell your free will. If nothing else, man, do not sell it cheap. You say, 'But this greatness belongs to Socrates.' And why, if we are born for this, do not all men become like him? Do all horses become swift? Do all dogs become hunters? Shall I then neglect my own nature because I am not naturally gifted? God forbid. I shall not be better than Socrates, but if I am not worse, that is enough. I shall not be Milo, yet I do not neglect my body; I shall not be Croesus, yet I do not neglect my property. In short, we must not abandon our discipline merely because we despair of reaching the highest perfection.",
    "notes": "This discourse is the definitive Stoic text on 'Prosopon' (Person/Character/Role). Epictetus teaches that while all humans share a universal rational nature, each individual possesses a specific character—a sense of personal dignity and role—that dictates what is endurable or unendurable for them specifically. The lesson focuses on three key points. First, the 'Calculus of Virtue': as soon as you weigh external safety (life, money) against your moral character, you have already degraded yourself. The man who asks 'what will happen if I don't do this?' has already lost his footing. Second, the 'Purple Stripe': the true philosopher must be willing to stand apart from the mob. Conformity to vice for the sake of safety renders you indistinguishable and useless, like a plain thread in a tunic. You must be the vibrant example that elevates humanity. Third, the necessity of 'Winter Training' (Cheimaskesai): Moral courage and a strong sense of self are not impulsive; they are the result of rigorous preparation. Finally, Epictetus addresses the fear of mediocrity. We should not abandon the pursuit of virtue simply because we may never equal Socrates. The goal is not to be the best in the world, but to be the best version of oneself, never selling one's moral will (Prohairesis) cheaply.",

    "english": "How, then, if one accepts that God is the father of mankind, should one proceed to the consequences? If you could truly absorb this doctrine—that we are all primarily generated by God, and that God is the Father of both men and gods—I believe you would never harbor an ignoble or mean thought about yourself. Consider this: If Caesar adopted you, your arrogance would be insufferable to everyone; yet knowing you are a son of Zeus, you feel no elevation? Sadly, now we do not act this way. Because two elements are mixed in our creation—the body, which we share with the animals, and reason, which we share with the gods—most people incline toward this wretched and dead kinship of the flesh, while only a few incline toward the divine and blessed connection. Since it is inevitable that every person treats himself according to his own estimation, those few who believe they are born for fidelity, modesty, and the correct use of impressions entertain no mean or low thoughts. But the majority cry out, 'What am I? A poor, miserable little man, nothing but wretched flesh.' Indeed, your flesh is wretched, but you possess something superior to the flesh! Why then do you abandon the superior to cling to the mud? Through this lower affinity, some of us become like wolves—faithless, treacherous, and harmful; others like lions—wild, savage, and untamed; but the greater part of us become foxes, the lowest scoundrels among the animals. For what is a slanderous and malicious man but a fox, or something even more unfortunate and base? Watch, therefore, and take heed that you do not degenerate into one of these miserable beasts.",
    "notes": "This passage outlines the fundamental Stoic anthropology: the duality of human nature. Epictetus posits that we are a composite of the bestial (body/soma) and the divine (reason/logos). The core lesson is that moral character is determined by which aspect of your nature you identify with. If you view yourself merely as a biological entity ('wretched flesh'), you will inevitably adopt animalistic behaviors—becoming predatory like a wolf, aggressive like a lion, or deceitful like a fox. This is a metaphorical degradation where the rational soul is enslaved by base instincts. However, by recognizing your 'cosmic kinship' as a child of Zeus (representing the universal reason), you elevate your standards of behavior to match that lineage. True self-respect, in Stoicism, is not egoism but the recognition of one's capacity for virtue. The practical application is to constantly monitor your self-talk: do not call yourself a 'miserable worm,' or you will act like one; remember you carry a god within you.",

    "english": "ON PROGRESS. The person who is actually making progress is the one who has learned from the philosophers that desire is directed toward the Good, and aversion toward the Evil. He has learned that serenity and a smooth flow of life are achieved only when a person does not fail to get what he desires, nor fall into what he seeks to avoid. He knows that if he tries to avoid things outside his control, he will inevitably clash with something contrary to his wish and suffer misfortune. If virtue promises to produce happiness, freedom from passion, and a good flow of life, then progress toward virtue is surely the approach toward these very ends. For wherever the perfection of anything tends, progress is always an approach toward that same thing. How is it, then, that we agree virtue is one thing, yet we seek progress and display it in something entirely different? What is the work of virtue? A life that flows smoothly. Who, then, is making progress? Is it the man who has read many treatises of Chrysippus? Is virtue merely the act of understanding Chrysippus? If so, then progress is nothing more than understanding a lot of Chrysippus. But since we admit that virtue produces one result (character), while looking for progress in another (books), look at the contradiction! We say, 'I can now read Chrysippus by myself.' You wretch! Seek progress where your real work lies. And where is your work? In the management of desire and aversion, so that you are never disappointed and never incur what you fear; in the management of impulse and refusal, so that you do not err; and in the management of assent, so that you are not deceived. The first areas are the most necessary. But if you are trembling and mourning while you seek to be free from misfortune, how are you making progress? Show me your progress in these matters! It is as if I were speaking to an athlete and said, 'Show me your shoulders,' and he replied, 'Look at my jumping weights.' Get out of here with your weights! I want to see the result of your training, not your equipment. You say, 'Take my treatise on Impulse and see how well I have read it.' Idiot! I am not asking about your reading. I want to know how you act in your desires and aversions, your intentions and plans. Do you act in harmony with nature, or contrary to it? If you act in harmony, show me that, and I will tell you that you are making progress. If contrary, go away! Do not merely expound on books, but go write similar ones yourself. And what good will it do you? Do you not know that the whole book costs five denarii? Do you think the one who interprets the book is worth more than five denarii? Never seek your work in one place and your progress in another. Where, then, is progress? If any of you, withdrawing from external things, has turned his attention to his own Moral Purpose (prohairesis), cultivating and laboring over it to make it consistent with nature—lofty, free, unhindered, unencumbered, faithful, and modest—then he is making progress. He has learned that he who desires or fears things not within his power can be neither faithful nor free, but must inevitably change and be tossed about with those things, and must inevitably subject himself to others who have the power to obtain or prevent them. When he rises in the morning, he observes these things; he bathes as a faithful man, eats as a modest man; in every matter that arises, he works on his ruling principle, just as a runner works on running or a voice trainer on the voice. This is the man who is truly making progress; this is the man who has not traveled in vain. But if he is intent on the mere practice of reading books, and labors only at that, I tell him to go home immediately and not neglect his duties there, for what he has come here for is worthless. The only thing that matters is studying how to remove grief, lamentation, and cries of 'Alas' and 'Wretched me' from one's life, and regarding death, exile, and prison not as evils. If this is what you call 'misfortune,' well, 'Dear Crito, if it pleases the gods, let it be so.' I am a wretched old man; have I kept my gray hairs for this? Who speaks like that? Do you think I am going to quote some obscure, lowly person? Does not Priam say it? Does not Oedipus? What are tragedies but the portrayal in verse of the sufferings of men who have admired external things? If a man had to be deceived into learning that external things and things outside our choice are nothing to us, I would accept that deception if it meant I could live smoothly and without disturbance; you must see for yourselves what you prefer. What, then, does Chrysippus offer us? He says, 'To let you know that these truths—from which serenity and freedom from passion arise—are not false, take my books and you will see.' It is like Triptolemus: all men have erected shrines and altars to him because he gave us cultivated food; but to the man who discovered and brought to light the truth and applied it to all humanity—not the truth about staying alive, but about living well—who among you has raised an altar, built a temple, or dedicated a statue? We sacrifice to the gods because they gave us vines or wheat; but because they produced such fruit in a human mind, by which they intended to show us the truth regarding happiness, shall we not thank God for this?",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus draws a sharp line between 'intellectual knowledge' and 'moral progress.' 1. The Trap of Academics: He criticizes students who mistake reading philosophy (specifically the dense logic of Chrysippus) for living philosophically. In Stoicism, books are merely the 'jumping weights' (halteres)—tools used to build muscle, not the muscle itself. To show off one's books is to show off one's tools while remaining weak in character. 2. The Definition of Progress (Prokopē): True progress is defined strictly by the state of the 'prohairesis' (moral choice/will). It is visible only when a person withdraws their concern from 'externals' (health, wealth, reputation) and focuses entirely on their own internal consistency. A person making progress is identified by how they handle daily activities (eating, bathing) and emotional challenges, acting with fidelity and modesty. 3. The Goal: The end of this progress is 'euroia' (a smooth flow of life) and 'apatheia' (freedom from suffering/passion). This state is achieved only when desire is confined to virtue (what is up to us) and aversion is confined to vice. If you fear things not up to you (death, exile), you are a slave to them and to the people who control them. 4. Gratitude for Reason: Finally, Epictetus compares the Stoic teachers to mythical givers of grain and wine. While society honors those who sustain mere biological life, the Stoic should revere the divine gift of Reason and Truth, which sustains the 'good life' and spiritual well-being.",

    "english": "Concerning the Academics. If a man takes a stand against truths that are aggressively obvious, it is not easy to find an argument to use against him. This is not because of any strength on his part, nor weakness on the part of the teacher; but when someone who has been cornered turns to stone, how can one reason with them further?\n\nNow, petrifaction is of two kinds: the petrifaction of the intellect, and the petrifaction of the sense of shame. The first occurs when a man is obstinately determined neither to assent to self-evident truths nor to withdraw from contradictions. The second involves the moral faculties.\n\nObserve how most of us behave: we fear the necrosis of the body and would devise any means to avoid falling into such a state, yet we care nothing if our soul is becoming necrotic. By Zeus! If a man's soul is in such a condition that he cannot follow a logical sequence or understand anything, we say he is in a bad way. But if his sense of shame and modesty is deadened, we actually go so far as to call this 'strength of character'!\n\nYou ask such a man: 'Do you comprehend that you are awake?'\n'No,' he replies, 'for even when I am asleep in my dreams, I have the impression that I am awake.'\n'Is there no difference between these states?'\n'None.'\n\nWhat fire or branding iron can I apply to such a man to make him perceive that he has grown numb? If he perceives it but pretends he does not, he is worse than a corpse. Does he not see the contradiction? He is in a bad state. Does he see it but is not moved to correct himself? He is in a still more wretched state. His sense of shame and his conscience have been cut out; his rational faculty has not been amputated, but it has been brutalized—turned into that of a wild beast.\n\nAm I to call this power? God forbid—unless I also call it 'power' when shameless degenerates say and do whatever comes into their heads in the middle of the public square.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus attacks the Skeptical Academy, which argued that certain knowledge (katalepsis) is impossible. To the Stoic, the refusal to acknowledge self-evident truths (prolepsis) is not a sign of intellectual rigor, but of spiritual sickness. Epictetus identifies two types of 'petrifaction' (hardening): 1) Intellectual hardening, where one refuses to accept logical necessity, and 2) Moral hardening, where one loses the capacity for 'aidos' (shame or modesty). \n\nThe core lesson is that philosophy requires a foundational sincerity. If you deny the evidence of your senses or the basic laws of logic just to win an argument or maintain a skeptical pose, you effectively deaden your human potential. Epictetus warns that we often prioritize the health of the body while ignoring the rot in our character. A mind that refuses to assent to obvious truth is not 'strong' or 'independent'; it is necrotic and bestial, having severed the rational and social bonds that define a human being.",

    "english": "It is easy to praise Providence for everything that happens in the world, provided you possess two qualities: the ability to see the comprehensive context of events, and a sense of gratitude. Without these, you will either fail to see the usefulness of what happens, or, even if you do see it, you will fail to be grateful. \n\nConsider the eyes. If God had created colors but not the faculty of vision to see them, of what use would they be? None. Conversely, if He had created the faculty of vision but made nothing capable of being seen, what use would that be? None. And even if He made both, but did not create light, neither would be of any use. Who, then, is it that has fitted this to that, and that to this? Who fitted the sword to the scabbard and the scabbard to the sword? Is there no one? Usually, from the very structure of constructed objects, we declare that they must be the work of a craftsman and not the product of chance. Does not the eye, the nature of light, the structure of the male and female and their desire for union—do these not demonstrate a Craftsman?\n\nAnd what of the constitution of our intellect? We are not merely stamped by impressions like wax; we select, we subtract, we add, we combine, and we pass from certain things to others by logic. Is this capacity capable of arising from chance? If so, let them explain to us how these wondrous and technical things come to be!\n\nAre these faculties found only in us? Many are shared with animals, but only to the extent required for their service. However, do they understand what happens? No. There is a difference between using something and understanding its use. God had need of animals to use appearances, but of us to understand the use of appearances. Therefore, it is enough for them to eat, drink, sleep, and breed. But for us, to whom He has given the faculty of monitoring and interpretation, these things are not enough. Unless we act methodically, according to our specific nature and constitution, we shall never attain our end.\n\nGod introduced man into the world to be a spectator of Him and His works; and not merely a spectator, but an interpreter. It is shameful, therefore, for a man to begin and end where the irrational animals do. He should rather begin there, but end where nature ends in our case: in contemplation, understanding, and a way of life in harmony with nature. Take care, then, that you do not die without having seen these things.\n\nYou journey to Olympia to see the work of Phidias, and you think it a misfortune to die without seeing it. Yet, you are already in the presence of God's own works—where you have no need to travel, but are already present—and you have no desire to observe and understand them? Will you never perceive who you are, what you were born for, and the purpose of your existence?\n\n'But,' you say, 'unpleasant and hard things happen in life.' Well, do they not happen at Olympia? Are you not scorched by the heat? Are you not crushed by the crowd? Is it not difficult to bathe? Are you not soaked when it rains? Do you not suffer from the noise and the shouting? Yet, I suppose, by weighing the value of the spectacle against these hardships, you endure them. \n\nCome now, have you not received faculties to bear whatever happens? Have you not received greatness of soul? Have you not received courage? Have you not received endurance? If I am great of soul, what concern have I for anything that might happen? What shall disturb me or confuse me? Shall I not use my power for the purpose it was given, instead of moaning and wailing over events?\n\n'But my nose is running!' says one. Slave! What do you have hands for, if not to wipe your nose? 'Is it reasonable, then, that there should be running noses in the world?' How much better it is to wipe your nose than to find fault! What do you think would have become of Hercules without the lion, the hydra, the stag, or the boar? If he had sat at home wrapped in bedclothes, he would not have been Hercules. These trials exercised him and proved him. \n\n'So,' you ask, 'should I seek out lions and boars?' No! That would be madness. But when they are present and found, they serve to show what you are made of. \n\nLook at the powers you have. Look at them and say: 'Bring on me now, O Zeus, whatever trouble you wish; for I have the equipment given to me by You, and the resources to adorn myself through whatever happens.' But no, you sit there trembling lest something should happen, and weeping and wailing over what does happen, and then you blame the gods! For what is the result of such meanness of spirit but impiety? \n\nGod has not only given us these faculties to endure events without being humiliated or broken, but—like a good King and a true Father—He has given them to us unhindered, uncompelled, and unrestricted. He has put them entirely in our own power, not reserving even to Himself the power to hinder or impede them. Yet, possessing these things free and your own, you do not use them. You do not perceive what you have received or from whom, but you sit grieving and groaning—some of you blind to the Giver, others turning to base complaints and accusations against God. \n\nI am prepared to show you that you have the resources and equipment for greatness of soul and courage; now you show me what resources you have for complaining and accusing!",
    "notes": "This discourse is a foundational text on Stoic teleology (the argument from design) and theodicy (the justification of God's goodness despite worldly hardship). \n\n1. **The Argument from Design:** Epictetus argues that the complexity of the world—specifically the matching of faculties (sight) to objects (color) via a medium (light)—implies a rational Craftsman (God/Nature). The existence of the human mind, which can process logic and memory, is further proof that the universe is not random. \n\n2. **The Human Function (Ergon):** Humans are distinct from animals. Animals interact with the world to survive (mere 'use'); humans have the capacity to 'understand the use' of their impressions. Our purpose is to be 'interpreters' of Nature. To live only for physical comfort is to fail at being human.\n\n3. **The Spectator of God:** The Olympia analogy is crucial. People endure physical suffering (heat, crowds) to see a man-made statue of Zeus, yet they complain about the suffering involved in living within the actual universe made by Zeus. Stoicism demands we view life as a festival: we are here to witness the grandeur of reality, and hardships are merely the 'crowds and heat' of the festival.\n\n4. **Hardship as Training:** The Hercules metaphor illustrates that external difficulties are necessary conditions for virtue. Virtue (courage, endurance) cannot exist in a vacuum; it requires 'material' (problems) to work upon. We should not seek out disaster (that is foolishness), but when it arrives, we must welcome it as the training ground for our character.\n\n5. **The 'Runny Nose' Doctrine:** Epictetus dismisses passive complaining with the famous retort: 'Wipe your nose.' This is a core Stoic principle: Do not ask for reality to change (no runny noses); use the resources you have (hands) to deal with reality. Complaining is a rejection of the tools God gave you.\n\n6. **Autonomy and Freedom:** The discourse ends with a reminder of the Dichotomy of Control. God gave us the mental faculties to bear any fortune, and He made those faculties 'unhindered'—meaning not even God interferes with our free will (prohairesis). To complain is to ignore our own power.",

    "english": "Most people are unaware that the study of changing arguments, hypothetical arguments, and those that conclude through questioning is actually a matter of moral duty. For what are we seeking in every area of life? We seek how the virtuous man may discover the truth and how he may avoid being deceived. So, either tell me that the virtuous man will not engage in question and answer, or admit that if he does, he must take care not to behave carelessly or haphazardly in the process. \n\nWhat is the promise of the faculty of reason? To establish what is true, to reject what is false, and to suspend judgment regarding the uncertain. Is it enough, then, merely to learn this definition? It is not. Just as it is not enough for a banker who wishes to avoid mistakes to merely hear that he must accept genuine coins and reject counterfeit ones; he must also acquire the faculty of testing and distinguishing the genuine from the false. So too in reasoning: it is not enough to simply state the goal; one must become capable of testing and distinguishing the true, the false, and the uncertain. \n\nFurthermore, what is prescribed in reasoning? 'Accept the consequence of what you have properly granted.' Is it enough to simply know this rule? No, you must learn how a consequence follows—how one thing follows from another, or how one thing follows from several combined. Therefore, anyone who intends to behave intelligently in argument—who wants to prove points himself and follow the demonstrations of others without being misled by sophists—must acquire this skill. This is why the study of syllogisms and logical modes is necessary.\n\nBut sometimes, we grant premises correctly, yet a false conclusion results. What is my duty then? To accept the falsehood? Impossible. To say I did not grant the premises? But that is not true. We must learn how to handle the shifting ground of arguments, just as we must know when to withdraw a loan. We must not stay committed to a premise when the context changes. We must study these changes so that we do not behave contrary to duty, carelessly or in confusion.\n\nThe same applies to hypothetical arguments. Sometimes it is necessary to request a hypothesis as a stepping stone for the argument. Should we grant every hypothesis? No. Which ones, then? This is an inquiry into duty. Someone might say, 'If you accept this hypothesis, I will force you to an impossible conclusion.' Who is the man properly equipped for argument? The one who cannot be deceived or trapped by sophistry. But if he has not trained in these logical exercises, how can he maintain the character we expect of him? So, stop making excuses for avoiding this work. \n\n'But,' you say, 'if I make a mistake in a syllogism, have I killed my father?' \n\nSlave! Where is your father here for you to kill? What have you done? You have committed the only error possible in this specific context. I once made a similar remark to Musonius Rufus when he scolded me for omitting a step in a syllogism: 'It is not as if I burned down the Capitol,' I said. He replied: 'Slave, in this context, the missing step *is* the Capitol.' \n\nDo you imagine that burning the Capitol and killing your father are the only forms of sin? Is it no sin to use your impressions blindly, carelessly, and at random? Is it no sin to fail to follow an argument, to be misled by a sophism, and to lack the ability to see what is consistent with your own position and what is not? Is none of this a sin?",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus makes a profound connection between Logic and Ethics. For the Stoic, Logic is not merely an academic game or abstract theory; it is a critical tool for the 'discipline of assent.' The core lesson here is that intellectual laziness is a moral vice. \n\n1. **The Duty of Logic:** The 'spoudaios' (virtuous person) has a duty to not be deceived. Since virtue depends on the correct use of impressions, and reasoning is the tool we use to process impressions, a failure in logic leads to a failure in life. If you cannot distinguish a valid inference from a fallacy, you will inevitably assent to falsehoods, which corrupts the soul.\n\n2. **The Banker Analogy:** Just as a banker needs the technical skill to test coins (not just the theoretical knowledge that 'fake coins are bad'), a Stoic needs the technical training to test arguments. Good intentions are insufficient without the capacity to discern truth.\n\n3. **The 'Capitol' Metaphor:** This is one of Epictetus's most famous rebukes. When the student minimizes a logical error by saying, 'I didn't kill my father,' Epictetus retorts that in the domain of logic, irrationality *is* the capital crime. To live in accordance with Nature is to live in accordance with Reason (Logos). Therefore, to be illogical, careless, or sloppy in one's thinking is to betray one's own human nature. In the classroom of the mind, a fallacy is as destructive as arson is to a city.",

    "english": "That specific faculties can be dangerous to the uneducated. Just as equivalent terms can be transposed in various ways, so too can the forms of arguments and enthymemes be varied in discourse. For instance: 'If you borrowed money and did not repay it, you owe me money.' This kind of logical manipulation belongs to no one more than the philosopher. For if the enthymeme is an imperfect syllogism, clearly the one trained in the perfect syllogism would be equally capable with the imperfect one. Why, then, do we not train ourselves and one another in this manner? Because even now, while we are not exercising ourselves in these matters—and are not distracted by me regarding the cultivation of character—we still make no progress toward moral excellence! What, then, should we expect if we added this occupation to our list? Not only would it be a distraction from more necessary things, but it would become a significant source of conceit and arrogance. For the power of argumentation and persuasion is great, especially if it gains further polish from training and the elegance of vocabulary. generally speaking, every such power is dangerous to the uneducated and weak, for it encourages them to become elated and puffed up by it. How, indeed, could anyone persuade a young man who excels in these rhetorical tricks that he should not become an appendage to them, but rather that they should be an appendage to him? Would he not trample all such warnings, walking around inflated and conceited, unable to tolerate anyone correcting him? 'But was Plato not a philosopher?' you ask. I answer: Was Hippocrates not a physician? Yet look at how Hippocrates writes. Does Hippocrates write that way *because* he is a physician? Why do you confuse things that merely happened to coincide in the same men? If Plato was handsome and strong, ought I to sit and lift weights so that I might become handsome or strong, believing this is necessary for philosophy, simply because a certain philosopher happened to be handsome and a philosopher? Will you not perceive and distinguish exactly *what* makes men philosophers and what other qualities are merely present in them by chance? Come now, if I were a philosopher, would you be required to become lame? Do I, then, reject these faculties of speech? God forbid! Neither do I reject the faculty of sight. But if you ask me what the Good of man is, I cannot answer you anything other than this: It is a certain kind of moral choice regarding the use of impressions.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus addresses the danger of technical skills—specifically logic and rhetoric—when possessed by someone lacking moral foundation ('the uneducated'). The core Stoic lesson is that skills and faculties (like eloquence, logic, or even physical strength) are 'indifferents' (adiaphora); they are tools that can be used for good or ill. The danger arises when a student confuses the tool with the goal. A young student skilled in debate may develop 'typhus' (arrogance/vanity), believing their clever speech makes them superior, when in reality, they have neglected their character. Epictetus uses the example of Plato to teach us to distinguish between the 'essential' and the 'accidental.' Plato was wise (essential to being a philosopher) and wrote beautifully (accidental/coincidental). To emulate a philosopher, one must emulate their ruling faculty (prohairesis), not their writing style or physical attributes. The 'Good' is not found in the sharpness of one's tongue or eyes, but in the correct moral choices made regarding the impressions one receives.",

    "english": "If what philosophers say regarding the kinship between God and man is true, what other course remains for men but that of Socrates? When asked to what country he belonged, he never replied, 'I am an Athenian,' or 'I am a Corinthian,' but rather, 'I am a citizen of the universe.' For why do you say that you are an Athenian, instead of identifying merely with that tiny corner where your wretched body was cast at birth? Clearly, you identify yourself by the higher and more comprehensive entity, which includes not only that corner and your whole house, but also the very source from which your ancestors' line has descended to you. \n\nTherefore, anyone who has observed the administration of the universe knows that the greatest, most sovereign, and most comprehensive community is this system composed of men and God. From God, the seeds of being have fallen not only into my father and grandfather but into all things that are born and grow on earth, and primarily into rational beings. For rational beings alone are by nature fitted to share in the society of God, being connected to Him by the bond of Reason. Why, then, should not such a man call himself a citizen of the universe? Why not a son of God? And why should he fear anything that happens among men? Is kinship with Caesar, or some other powerful man in Rome, sufficient to enable you to live in safety, free from contempt and fear? But to have God as your Maker, Father, and Guardian—shall this not deliver us from our sorrows and terrors?\n\n'But,' one asks, 'how shall I eat if I have nothing?' How do slaves, how do runaways survive? On what do they rely when they leave their masters? On their lands or their servants or their silver? No, on nothing but themselves; and yet they do not fail to find food. Must our philosopher, then, go about placing his confidence in others, checking off the list of those who will feed him, instead of taking care of himself? Is he to be baser and more cowardly than the wild beasts? For each beast is self-sufficient, lacking neither its proper food nor its natural way of life.\n\nI myself think that the old teacher ought to be sitting here not to devise methods to keep you from thinking too lowly or meanly of yourselves, but rather to prevent the opposite. There should be young men of such high spirit that, realizing their kinship to the gods, and seeing that we are fettered by these bodies and their possessions, they would want to throw it all aside as a burdensome and useless weight, and depart to their kin. Then strictly, your teacher would have to contend with you, saying: 'Men, wait for God! When He gives the signal and releases you from this service, then you shall be released to Him. But for the present, endure to dwell in this place where He has stationed you. Short indeed is the time of your dwelling here, and easy for those who are thus minded. For what tyrant, what thief, what court of law is formidable to those who count the body and its possessions as nothing? Stay, do not depart without reason!'\n\nThis is what should happen between a teacher and ingenious youth. But what happens now? Your teacher is a corpse, and you are corpses. As soon as you have eaten your fill today, you sit crying about tomorrow, asking 'Where shall I eat?' Slave! If you have it, you will have it; if not, you will depart. The door is open! Why do you grieve? Where is there room for tears? Why allow one man to envy another? Why admire the rich or the powerful, even if they are strong and angry? For what can they do to us? We will pay no attention to the things they have power to do; and the things we care about, they cannot touch. Who then can rule a man who is thus minded?\n\nHow did Socrates behave? Exactly as one who was convinced of his kinship with the gods. If you were to say to me now, 'Epictetus, we will acquit you on the condition that you no longer engage in this discourse or annoy the young,' I would answer: 'You are ridiculous. If your general had stationed me at a post, I would have to maintain it and choose to die a thousand times rather than abandon it. But if God has stationed me in a certain place and way of life, ought I to abandon that?' This is a man who is truly a kinsman of the gods. But we? We think of ourselves as mere bellies, intestines, and genitals. We fear, we desire; we flatter those who can help us in these matters, and we dread the same people.\n\nA man once asked me to write to Rome on his behalf, as he had met with 'misfortune'—having been formerly illustrious and rich, but now stripped of everything. I wrote a humble letter for him. He read it and handed it back, saying: 'I wanted your help, not your pity; nothing bad has happened to me.' Similarly, Musonius Rufus used to test me by saying, 'Your master is going to do such-and-such to you.' When I answered, 'Those are the inevitable things of human life,' he would say, 'Why then should I intercede with him for you, when you can receive these things from yourself?' For indeed, it is foolish and superfluous to beg from another what one can obtain from oneself. Since I can get greatness of soul and nobility from myself, shall I beg for a patch of land or a bit of money from you? God forbid. But when a man is cowardly and base, one must write letters for him as if interceding for a corpse: 'Please grant us the body of this man and a pint of his blood.' For such a man is nothing but a corpse and a pint of blood; if he were anything more, he would realize that one man cannot be made miserable by another.",
    "notes": "This discourse centers on the Stoic concept of 'Cosmopolitanism'—the idea that our primary citizenship is in the universe (Kosmos) rather than a specific city-state. Epictetus argues that realizing our kinship with the Divine (Reason/Logos) renders external fears obsolete. \n\n1. **Divine Kinship vs. Earthly Status:** Just as a Roman citizen feels safe because of Caesar, a rational being should feel invincible because of God. If our 'true self' is the rational mind, not the clay body, external tyrants have no leverage over us.\n\n2. **The 'Open Door':** A crucial metaphor in Epictetus. We are soldiers stationed by God. We must not desert our post (suicide) frivolously just because we despise the body. However, if circumstances become truly impossible (like a room filled with smoke), the door is open—we can leave life. This knowledge alone should eliminate the fear of hunger or poverty. If you can eat, eat; if not, you die and return to the elements. Neither is a cause for anxiety.\n\n3. **Autarkeia (Self-Sufficiency):** The anecdote about Musonius Rufus highlights that a Stoic should not beg others for relief from hardship. The capacity to endure and find peace is an internal resource. To beg for external safety is to admit you are merely a 'corpse and a pint of blood'—biological matter without a ruling soul.",

    "english": "To those obsessed with advancement in Rome. If only we applied ourselves to our proper work with the same intensity! I know a man older than myself, currently the prefect of the grain supply at Rome. When he passed through here on his return from exile, he spoke to me vividly, denouncing his former life and swearing that upon his return, he would devote his remaining days to nothing but peace and tranquility. 'For how little life is left to me?' he asked. I told him: 'You will not do it. As soon as you catch the scent of Rome, you will forget all these resolutions.' He retorted: 'Epictetus, if you find me setting even one foot in the court, think of me whatever you wish.' So what did he do? Before he even entered the city, letters from Caesar met him. He seized them, forgot everything he had said, and ever since has piled one ambitious burden upon another. I wish I could stand beside him now to remind him of those words he spoke when passing through, and say: 'How much better a prophet am I than you!' What then? Am I saying that man is a creature made for inactivity? Heaven forbid! But why are we not active in the right way? I admit my own fault first: when day breaks, I remind myself briefly of what I ought to read. But then I say to myself, 'What do I care how this or that person reads? The first thing is for me to get some sleep.' And yet, compare their business with ours! If you observe what they do, you will see the difference. They spend the whole day calculating, debating, and consulting about a little grain, a plot of land, or similar profits. Is it really the same thing to read a petition saying, 'I beg you to permit me to export a little grain,' compared to one saying, 'I beg you to learn from Chrysippus about the administration of the universe, and what place the rational creature holds within it; learn, too, who you are, and what constitutes your good and your evil'? are these things similar? Do they demand the same kind of zeal? Is it equally shameful to neglect the one as the other? Well then, is it only we instructors who are lazy and drowsy? No, you young men are far worse! For we old men, when we see children playing, feel an urge to join their play. In the same way, if I saw you thoroughly awake and eager, I too would be eager to join you in your serious studies.",
    "notes": "This discourse contrasts two types of ambition: the worldly ambition for status (exemplified by the official in Rome) and the philosophical ambition for wisdom. Epictetus illustrates the psychological mechanism of 'pre-commitment failure.' The older man, while in exile (a state of reduced external distraction), correctly identifies that peace of mind (ataraxia) is the goal. However, because his judgment was based on circumstance rather than a hardened character, the moment the stimulus of power (the scent of Rome) returned, his resolve collapsed. This teaches that true Stoic freedom is not merely wishing for peace, but training the mind to resist external impressions. Furthermore, Epictetus defends the 'inactivity' of the philosopher. While the world sees the politician as 'active' (calculating grain, arguing cases), the Stoic sees this as busy-work for 'indifferents.' True activity is the study of the cosmos, the nature of the rational animal, and the distinction between good and evil. Finally, he notes the symbiotic relationship between teacher and student: the lethargy of the student dampens the fire of the teacher.",

    "english": "When a certain magistrate came to me, I inquired about his specific situation, asking if he had a wife and children. When he admitted that he did, I asked further, 'How then do you fare in these matters?'\n\n'Miserably,' he replied.\n\n'In what way?' I asked. 'For surely men do not marry and produce children to be miserable, but rather to be happy.'\n\n'But I,' he said, 'am so wretchedly anxious about my little children that recently, when my little daughter was sick and seemed in danger, I could not bear to even be present with her. I fled and went away until someone brought me news that she was well.'\n\n'Well then,' I said, 'do you think you acted correctly in doing this?'\n\n'It was natural,' he replied.\n\n'But,' said I, 'if you can convince me that it was natural, I will convince you that everything which takes place according to nature takes place correctly.'\n\n'This is how all, or at least most, fathers feel,' he said.\n\n'I do not deny that it happens,' I replied, 'but the point in dispute between us is whether it is right. For by that reasoning, we must say that tumors form for the good of the body simply because they happen, and simply that making mistakes is natural because almost all of us make mistakes. So show me: how is this according to nature?'\n\n'I cannot,' he said. 'Rather, you show me how it is not according to nature and not done correctly.'\n\nI answered: 'If we were inquiring about white and black things, what criterion would we summon to distinguish them?'\n\n'Sight,' he said.\n\n'And what if we were discussing hot and cold, or hard and soft?'\n\n'Touch.'\n\n'Therefore, since we are debating things consistent with nature versus those done rightly or wrongly, what criterion do you want us to adopt?'\n\n'I do not know,' he said.\n\n'And yet, to remain ignorant of the criterion for colors or smells might be no great loss; but to be ignorant of the criterion for good and evil, and for what is natural or unnatural to man—do you think this is a small penalty?'\n\n'The greatest indeed.'\n\n'Come now, tell me: do all things that seem good to people strike them as right? For instance, right now, can everything that seems correct to Jews, Syrians, Egyptians, and Romans concerning food be right?'\n\n'How could that be possible?'\n\n'It is absolutely necessary, I think, that if the views of the Egyptians are right, those of the others are not; if the views of the Jews are well, the others are not.'\n\n'Certainly.'\n\n'Now, where there is ignorance, there is also lack of understanding and a lack of education regarding essential things.'\n\nHe agreed.\n\n'You, therefore,' I said, 'perceiving this, will henceforth study nothing else and focus your mind on nothing else but this: how to learn the criterion of what is according to nature and, using it, distinguish each particular case. But for the present, I can help you this much regarding what you wish: Does family affection seem to you to be according to nature and good?'\n\n'How could it be otherwise?'\n\n'What then? Is affection natural and good, but being reasonable not good?'\n\n'By no means.'\n\n'So there is no conflict between being reasonable and being affectionate?'\n\n'It does not seem so to me.'\n\n'Otherwise,' I said, 'if they conflicted, and one was natural, the other would necessarily be unnatural?'\n\n'Correct,' he said.\n\n'Therefore, whatever we find to be both affectionate and reasonable, this we may confidently declare to be right and good?'\n\n'Agreed.'\n\n'What then? To leave a sick child and go away—is there any reason to think this is reasonable? I do not think you will argue that it is. But let us examine if it is affectionate.'\n\n'Let us examine it.'\n\n'Did you, simply because you were affectionately disposed toward the child, act rightly in running away and abandoning her? Does the mother not love the child?'\n\n'She certainly does.'\n\n'Should the mother, then, have also left her?'\n\n'She should not.'\n\n'And the nurse? Does she love the child?'\n\n'She does.'\n\n'Should she then also have left her?'\n\n'By no means.'\n\n'And the tutor? Does he not love her?'\n\n'He does.'\n\n'Should he too have fled and gone away, so that the child would be left deserted and helpless due to the great affection of you, her parents, and those around her—or perhaps die in the hands of those who neither loved nor cared for her?'\n\n'God forbid.'\n\n'And indeed, is it not unfair and ungrateful for a man to think it proper that, because of his affection, he should not be allowed to do the very thing he expects others (who love strictly the same way) to do?'\n\n'Absurd.'\n\n'Come now, if you were sick, would you want your relatives, and your wife and children, to be so affectionate that they would leave you all alone and deserted?'\n\n'By no means.'\n\n'Would you pray to be loved by your own people in such a way that, due to their extreme affection, you would always be left alone in sickness? Or would you not rather pray, if it were possible, to be loved by your enemies, so that at least they would leave you alone? If this is the case, it remains that what you did was in no way an act of affection.\n\n'What then? Was there nothing that moved you and incited you to leave the child? How could that be? It was some motive, just as in Rome when a man covers his head while his horse runs; and then, if his horse wins contrary to expectation, they need sponges to revive him from his faint. What is this motive?\n\n'To define it precisely is not for the present moment. But it is enough to be convinced of this—if what the philosophers say is sound: we must not look for the cause anywhere outside ourselves. It is one and the same thing that causes us to do something or not do it, to speak or not speak, to be elated or depressed, to flee or pursue. It is the very same cause that has now led you to come to me and sit hearing me, and me to speak these things.'\n\n'What is that?'\n\n'Is it anything other than that it seemed right to us?'\n\n'Nothing else.'\n\n'And if it had seemed otherwise to us, what else would we be doing than what we thought best? Was this not the cause of Achilles' mourning—not the death of Patroclus (for another man does not react thus when a companion dies), but because it seemed right to him? And for you, the cause of your running away was simply that it seemed right to you. And conversely, if you stay, it is because it seems right to you. Now you return to Rome because it seems right to you; and if your opinion changes, you will not return. simply put, neither death, nor exile, nor toil, nor anything of the sort is the cause of our doing or not doing anything, but only our opinions and dogmas. Do I persuade you of this or not?'\n\n'You persuade me.'\n\n'Therefore, whenever we do something wrongly, from this day forward we shall blame nothing else but the judgment (dogma) from which we acted; and we shall try to cut out and remove that judgment more than we would tumors or abscesses from the body. In the same way, we shall acknowledge this same cause for our right actions. We shall no longer blame slave, or neighbor, or wife, or children as being the causes of any evils to us, being persuaded that unless it seems to us that things are such, we do not perform the consequent actions. Of appearing or not appearing, we are the masters, not external things.'\n\n'So it is,' he said.\n\n'From this day, then, we shall investigate and examine nothing else—not the nature of our land, or our slaves, or our horses, or our dogs—but only our judgments.'\n\n'I pray to do so,' he said.\n\n'You see, then, that you must become a student—that animal at which everyone laughs—if you truly wish to make an examination of your own judgments. And that this is not the work of a single hour or day, you know yourself.'",
    "notes": "This discourse is a masterclass in Stoic psychology and the dichotomy of control. The central lesson is that 'affection' (philostorgia) acts as a mask for selfishness when it is divorced from reason (logos). 1) The Distinction of Passions: The father believes his distress is a sign of love. Epictetus proves that his distress actually led him to abandon the object of his love (the sick child) to escape his own emotional pain. True love is rational and practical; it stands fast and helps. 2) The Criterion of Truth: We cannot rely on 'what feels natural' or 'what everyone else does' (consensus) to determine right action. We need a tested criterion—Logic and Reason. 3) The Theory of Action: Epictetus introduces the core Stoic dogma that external events (sickness, death) do not cause our actions or emotions. Only our 'judgment' (dogma) about those events causes our reaction. Achilles mourned not because Patroclus died, but because of his opinion about death. The father fled not because the child was sick, but because he judged the suffering to be unbearable. 4) The Cure: The only path to freedom and virtue is to stop blaming externals (wives, slaves, gods) and assume full responsibility for one's own judgments. This requires becoming a 'student'—humbling oneself to relearn how to live.",

    "english": "Concerning Contentment. \n\nRegarding the gods, there are some who say the Divine does not exist. Others say it exists, but is inactive, careless, and exercises no forethought. A third group says it exists and provides, but only for the great and celestial things, not for anything on earth. A fourth group says it cares for earthly and human affairs, but only in a general sense, not for the individual. And there is a fifth group, to which Odysseus and Socrates belonged, who say: 'I do not move without Thy knowledge.'\n\nBefore all else, then, it is necessary to examine each of these views to see if it is sound. For if there are no gods, how can it be our end to follow them? If they exist but care for nothing, how is that sound? And even if they exist and care, but there is no communication from them to men—and specifically to me—how is that a sound doctrine? The good and excellent man, having examined all this, submits his mind to the One who administers the universe, just as good citizens submit to the law of the city.\n\nThe person who is being educated ought to approach his training with this aim: 'How can I follow the gods in everything? How can I be content with the divine administration? How can I become free?' For he is free to whom all things happen according to his will, and whom no one can hinder. 'What then? Is freedom simply madness?' Heaven forbid! Madness and freedom do not go together. 'But,' you say, 'I want everything I fancy to happen, no matter how I fancy it.' You are mad; you are out of your mind! Do you not know that freedom is a noble and precious thing? But for me to desire haphazardly whatever happens to pop into my head is not only not noble, it is dangerously erratic.\n\nHow do we proceed in grammar? Do I wish to write the name of 'Dion' however I please? No. I am taught to wish to write it exactly as it ought to be written. What about music? The same. And in general, in any art or science? Otherwise, knowledge would be worthless if it merely accommodated everyone's whims. And here, in the greatest and most sovereign matter of all—freedom—shall I be allowed to wish just as I please? By no means! Rather, education is precisely this: learning to wish that everything should happen exactly as it does. And how does it happen? As the Ordainer has ordained.\n\nHe has ordained that there be summer and winter, abundance and famine, virtue and vice, and all such opposites for the harmony of the whole; and He has given each of us a body, property, and associates. Keeping this arrangement in mind, we should approach instruction not to alter the facts (for that is neither given to us nor is it better), but so that, with things being as they are by nature, we may keep our own will in harmony with what comes to pass.\n\nBut you—you are miserable and discontented. If you are alone, you call it 'desolation'; if you are with men, you call them 'plotters' and 'robbers,' and you find fault with your own parents, children, brothers, and neighbors. You ought, when staying alone, to call it 'peace' and 'liberty' and consider yourself equal to the gods; and when in a crowd, you should not call it a mob or a nuisance, but a festival and a assembly, and accept it all with contentment.\n\nWhat, then, is the punishment for those who do not accept this? It is simply to be as they are. Is someone discontented with being alone? Let him be in 'desolation.' Is someone discontented with his parents? Let him be a bad son and lament. Throw him into prison? What prison? He is already in one: his own state of mind. \n\n'Woe is me,' you say, 'I have such a terrible father!' Did you expect to choose your father? It was necessary that your parents exist first, and then you be born from them. From what kind of parents? Such as they were. What then? Since they are such as they are, is there no resource given to you? If you possess the faculty of sight but close your eyes when colors are presented, you would be wretched. But you possess greatness of soul and nobility to handle every circumstance; yet you ignore these powers and fixate on the external faults. You are accountable only for what is in your power—the right use of impressions. Why do you draw upon yourself burdens for which you are not responsible?\n\nHow, then, can one do everything in a way that is pleasing to the gods? When someone asked this, Epictetus replied: 'If you eat justly, and with a grateful spirit, and temperately, and decently, are you not satisfying the gods?'",
    "notes": "Epictetus addresses the concept of 'Euarestesis' (being well-pleasing or content) with the Divine Administration. \n\n1. **Theological Foundation:** He categorizes ancient views on divinity, ultimately endorsing the Socratic/Stoic view of an active, all-pervading Providence that observes individual human action. This is crucial because Stoic ethics rely on aligning one's will with the rational order of the cosmos (Nature/God).\n\n2. **Redefining Freedom:** He attacks the layman's definition of freedom (doing whatever one randomly wants). He uses the analogy of 'Grammar' and 'Music' to show that true freedom requires submission to the rules of the art. In the 'Art of Living,' freedom is not changing reality to fit our whims, but disciplining our desires to accept reality as it occurs. This is the 'Discipline of Desire' (orexis).\n\n3. **The Festival Metaphor:** Life is compared to a festival or public gathering. We do not control the crowd or the events, but we control our participation and attitude. Complaining about the 'noise' of the festival is a failure of character, not a failure of the festival.\n\n4. **Accountability and Determining the Self:** Epictetus emphasizes that we are not responsible for our 'givens' (parents, body, environment). These are 'indifferents' (adiaphora). We are only punished or rewarded by our own moral choices (prohairesis). The 'punishment' for a bad attitude is simply the misery of having that attitude—Stoicism holds that vice is its own penalty.\n\n5. **Practical Application:** The excerpt concludes with a specific application to eating. Pleasing the gods does not require grand sacrifices, but performing mundane acts (like eating) with virtue—justice, temperance, and gratitude. This sanctifies daily life.",

    "english": "When someone asked how it is possible to eat in a way that is pleasing to the gods, I replied: If you eat justly, with a grateful spirit, with self-control, and with decency, are you not also acting pleasingly to the gods? Furthermore, when you call for warm water and the slave does not answer, or answers but brings it lukewarm, or is not even found in the house—is not refraining from anger or exploding with rage pleasing to the gods? \n\n'But how,' you ask, 'can anyone endure such things?' \n\nSlave! Will you not endure your own brother, who has Zeus as his forefather, who is born like a son from the same seeds and the same heavenly descent as you? Or because you have been stationed in a position of authority, will you immediately set yourself up as a tyrant? Do you not remember who you are and over whom you rule? That they are your kinsmen, your brothers by nature, the offspring of Zeus? \n\n'But I have a bill of sale for them,' you say, 'and they have none for me.' \n\nDo you see where you are looking? You are looking at the earth, at the pit, at these wretched laws of the dead; but you are not looking at the laws of the gods!",
    "notes": "This passage centers on the Stoic doctrine of Cosmopolitanism—the belief that all human beings are citizens of the same universe and share a divine lineage through their capacity for Reason (Logos). Epictetus challenges the social convention of slavery by contrasting the 'laws of the dead' (human legal codes and property rights) with the 'laws of the gods' (the natural kinship of all rational beings). Practically, this means that external status is irrelevant to moral duty. Whether eating a meal or dealing with a disobedient servant, the Stoic must maintain self-control and treat others with the dignity due to a 'brother by nature,' rather than letting trivial inconveniences provoke anger.",

    "english": "When a student asked how one might be convinced that each of his actions is overseen by God, I replied: Do you not think that all things in the universe are united in one entity? Do you not admit that earthly things feel the sympathy and influence of heavenly things? Consider how nature works: when God commands the plants to flower, they flower; when He commands them to grow, they grow; to bear fruit, they bear fruit; and to ripen, they ripen. Then, at His command, they shed their leaves, withdraw into themselves, and rest. From where does this order come, this synchronicity with the waxing and waning of the moon and the movements of the sun? If the plants and even our own bodies are so bound up with the universe, are not our souls much more so? Your souls are bound to God, linked to Him, being fragments and torn portions of His own being. Does He not, then, sense every movement of these parts as if they were His own? Consider your own capacity: you can think about divine administration and human affairs simultaneously; you receive impressions from countless sensory inputs, assent to some, and reject others. You preserve memories of so many diverse things. If you can do this, is God not able to oversee all things, be present with all things, and maintain communication with all? But you say, 'I cannot follow all these things at once.' I do not say you have the power of Zeus! But, because you are limited, God has assigned a guardian to each of you—your own particular 'daemon' or genius—and has committed you to his protection. This guardian never sleeps and cannot be deceived. To what better or more careful watcher could He have entrusted you? Therefore, when you close your doors and create darkness within, remember never to say that you are alone. You are not alone! God is within, and your genius is within; what need do they have of light to see what you are doing? To this God you ought to swear an oath, just as soldiers do to Caesar. Soldiers, for the sake of a paycheck, swear to prioritize Caesar’s safety above all else. Will you, who have received so many and such great blessings, not swear an oath? And if you do, what will you swear? You must swear never to disobey, never to accuse, never to find fault with anything that has been given to you, and never to do or suffer anything unwillingly. Is this oath like the soldier's? Far from it. They swear to value the life of another above all; you swear to value your own true self above all else.",
    "notes": "In Discourse 1.14, Epictetus grounds his ethics in Stoic physics (Pantheism). He argues for 'Sympatheia' (cosmic sympathy), the idea that the universe is a unified, living organism where all parts act in concert. The central lesson is that humans possess a 'divine spark'—the rational soul is literally a fragment ('apospasma') of God. This leads to two practical applications: 1) There is no such thing as privacy; your internal moral reasoning (your 'daemon' or conscience) is always observed by the Divine because it *is* part of the Divine. 2) The 'Philosopher's Oath' contrasts with the soldier's oath. While soldiers pledge loyalty to an external master (Caesar) for money, the Stoic pledges loyalty to the God within (Reason/Nature). The ultimate goal is to value one's own moral integrity above all else, accepting whatever Nature assigns without complaint.",

    "english": "When a man consulted me on how he might persuade his brother to cease being angry with him, I replied: Philosophy does not promise to secure anything external for man; if it did, it would be taking on matters outside its proper subject matter. For just as wood is the material of the carpenter, and bronze that of the sculptor, so the subject matter of the art of living is each person's own life.\n\n'What then of my brother's life?'\n\nThat belongs to his own art; but with respect to yours, it is one of the external things, like a piece of land, like health, like reputation. Philosophy promises none of these. Its promise is: 'In every circumstance I will maintain the ruling faculty in accordance with nature.' Whose ruling faculty? My own.\n\n'How, then, is he to stop being angry with me?'\n\nBring him to me and I will speak to him; but to you I have nothing to say regarding his anger.\n\nWhen the man who was consulting me said, 'This is what I am looking for: how, even if he is not reconciled, I may remain in accordance with nature,' I answered: Nothing great comes into being suddenly, not even a bunch of grapes or a fig. If you say to me now, 'I want a fig,' I shall answer, 'That requires time.' Let the tree first blossom, then put forth fruit, and finally let the fruit ripen. If the fruit of a fig tree is not brought to perfection suddenly or in a single hour, do you think you will acquire the fruit of a human mind so quickly and easily? I tell you, do not expect it.",
    "notes": "This discourse clarifies the boundaries of Stoic practice. The 'hyle' (material) of a Stoic is their own volition and character, not the actions or feelings of others. Attempting to use philosophy to manipulate external outcomes—such as a brother's anger—is a misunderstanding of the art. The lesson emphasizes two core principles: 1) The dichotomy of control: we are responsible only for our own ruling faculty (hegemonikon), while the reactions of others are 'externals' outside our moral sphere. 2) The necessity of patience: moral progress (the 'fruit' of the mind) is an organic process requiring time and cultivation, much like agriculture. One cannot simply demand instant wisdom or equanimity without doing the work of cultivation.",

    "english": "Do not be surprised that for other animals their bodily needs are ready-made—not just food and drink, but also their bedding, and their lack of need for shoes, blankets, or clothes—while we, on the other hand, require all of these things. For those creatures created not for their own sake but for service, it would not have been profitable to create them in need of others. Consider what it would be like if we had to worry not only about ourselves but also about sheep and donkeys—how to clothe them, how to shoe them, how to feed and water them! But just as soldiers appear ready before their general—shod, clothed, and armed—and it would be a terrible thing if the colonel had to go around shoeing and clothing his thousand men, so too Nature has made these animals, created for service, ready and prepared, requiring no further care. So, even a single small child can drive a flock of sheep with a stick. \n\nBut now, instead of giving thanks that we do not have to take equal care of them, we complain against God regarding our own maintenance! Yet, by Zeus and the gods, one single fact of creation would suffice to make a modest and grateful man perceive Providence. Do not even speak to me of great things; look at this very thing: the hair on the chin. Is it useless? Did Nature not use it in the most fitting way possible? Did she not distinguish the male and the female by it? Does not the nature of each of us cry out from afar: 'I am a man; approach me in this way, speak to me in this way, seek nothing else; here are the signs'? ... Therefore, we ought to preserve the signs God has given and not throw them away, nor confuse, as much as we can, the genders which have been distinguished.\n\nAre these the only works of Providence regarding us? What speech is sufficient to praise them or portray them? If we had any sense, what else should we do, both publicly and privately, than sing hymns to the Divine, praise Him, and recount His benefits? Should we not, while digging, plowing, and eating, sing the hymn to God? 'Great is God, for He has given us these instruments by which we till the earth; great is God, for He has given us hands, the power to swallow, a stomach, the imperceptible growth of the body, and the breath we draw while sleeping.' We ought to sing these things on every occasion, and above all, sing the greatest and divinest hymn: that He has given us the faculty to comprehend these things and to use them systematically.\n\nWhat then? Since most of you have become blind, was it not necessary that there be someone to fill this station and sing the hymn to God on behalf of everyone? For what else can I do, a lame old man, but sing hymns to God? If I were a nightingale, I would perform the work of a nightingale; if a swan, the work of a swan. But now, I am a rational being; I must praise God. This is my work; I do it, and I will not abandon this post as long as it is granted to me, and I call upon you to join in this same song.",
    "notes": "In this famous chapter (Discourses 1.16), Epictetus addresses the relationship between Providence (the rational ordering of the universe) and the human faculty of Reason (Logos). \n\n1. **The Hierarchy of Being:** Animals are 'servants' to nature's design, provided with fur, claws, and instinct because they lack the capacity to shape their own environment. Humans are born 'naked' because we possess the divine spark of Reason, allowing us to craft our own lives and tools. Our physical vulnerability is actually an opportunity to exercise our intelligence.\n\n2. **Teleology:** Epictetus argues that biological features (like a beard) are not accidents but intentional signs designed to facilitate social order. To reject these signs is to reject the role Nature assigned to you.\n\n3. **Rational Worship:** The climax of the passage defines the true function (ergon) of a human being. It is not merely to survive (like the sheep) but to understand the cosmic order and articulate gratitude for it. \n\n4. **The Lame Old Man:** Epictetus refers to his own physical disability ('lame old man') to demonstrate that while the body is indifferent and subject to fate, the Rational Will remains free to praise God. He views his role as a philosopher not as a burden, but as a soldier holding a post assigned by the General (God), which is to be the 'voice' of gratitude for a silent universe.",

    "english": "Since Reason is the faculty that analyzes and perfects all other things, it ought not itself remain unanalyzed. But what will analyze it? Clearly, either it analyzes itself, or something else does. Now, this 'something else' must either be Reason, or something superior to Reason—which is impossible. If it is Reason, who will analyze that in turn? If it analyzes itself, then the first Reason could have done so as well. If we require yet another thing, the process will be infinite and never-ending.\n\n'But,' you say, 'it is more urgent to cure our vices and errors than to study logic.'\n\nWell, if you say to me, 'I do not know whether you are arguing truly or falsely,' how shall I prove it to you? I must use a distinction—a logical definition. But if we have not first learned what a 'bushel' is, or what a 'scale' is, how can we measure or weigh anything? So, in this matter, if we have not fully mastered the criterion by which we judge other things, how shall we be able to judge or understand them accurately?\n\n'Yes,' you object, 'but the bushel-measure is mere wood and bears no fruit.'\n\nTrue, but it can measure grain. Logic, you say, is also unfruitful. Who says this? Only Chrysippus, Zeno, and Cleanthes? Does not Antisthenes also say that the beginning of education is the examination of terms?\n\nSo, is the great and admirable task merely to understand Chrysippus? No. What is the task? To understand the Will of Nature. Well then, can you follow Nature on your own? If you could, you would need no one else. But since we all err against our will and you do not yet understand the truth, you need a guide. Who explains Nature? They say Chrysippus does.\n\nI go and inquire what this interpreter of Nature says. I begin not to understand him. I seek someone to interpret the interpreter. And here, look you, is there any reason for the interpreter to be arrogant? No more than there is for Chrysippus himself, if he is merely interpreting the Will of Nature and not following it himself. We do not need Chrysippus for his own sake, but only to follow Nature. Just as we do not need the sacrificial priest for his own sake, but because through him we hope to understand the signs given by the gods. We do not admire the crow that caws the omen; we admire the God who signals through the crow.\n\nI go, therefore, to this interpreter and priest and say: 'Inspect the entrails for me; tell me what is signified.'\n\nHe takes them, spreads them out, and interprets: 'Man, you have a Will—a moral purpose—that is by nature unhindered and uncompelled. This is written here in the entrails. I will show you. Can anyone hinder you from assenting to the truth? No one. Can anyone force you to accept a lie? No one. Do you see that in this faculty you are free from hindrance, compulsion, and obstruction?'\n\n'But,' you say, 'if someone threatens me with death, he compels me.'\n\nIt is not the threat that compels you; it is your own judgment that it is better to do his bidding than to die. It is your own judgment compelling you—that is, Will compelling Will. For if God had made this specific part of Himself, which He detached and gave to us, subject to hindrance or compulsion by another, He would no longer be God, nor would He be caring for us as He ought.\n\nThis is what I find in the sacred rites. This is what the signs tell you: If you wish, you are free. If you wish, you will blame no one and accuse no one; everything will be in accordance with your own mind and the mind of God.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus defends the study of logic, not as an end in itself, but as the necessary instrument for living correctly. He uses the analogy of a measuring cup (modius): the cup itself produces no food, but without it, we cannot measure the grain required to feed ourselves. Similarly, logic does not produce happiness directly, but without it, we cannot distinguish between true and false impressions, leading to moral errors.\n\nHe then addresses the role of philosophical texts and teachers. One should not study Chrysippus (a prominent Stoic logician) merely to quote him or admire his intellect. The philosopher is merely a translator or a priest interpreting the 'signs' of Nature. The ultimate message revealed by this interpretation is the doctrine of the Unconquerable Will (Prohairesis). \n\nEpictetus concludes with a powerful assertion of psychological freedom: 'Will compels Will' (Prohairesis compels Prohairesis). External events, such as the threat of death, do not force our actions; our own judgment regarding those events compels us. Therefore, since our assent is internally generated, we possess a fragment of the Divine that is by nature free and unhindered.",

    "english": "If what the philosophers say is true—that there is one governing principle for all men, just as we assent to what seems true and reject what seems false, and suspend judgment on what is uncertain, so too we move toward what seems beneficial and avoid what seems harmful—then why are we still angry with the majority? You say, 'Because they are thieves and robbers!' But what is a thief or a robber? Is it not someone who has gone astray regarding what is good and what is bad? If this is the case, should you be angry with them, or should you pity them? Show them their error, and you will see how they desist from their faults. But if they do not see it, they have nothing superior to their own impressions.\n\n'What then?' you ask, 'Should this robber and this adulterer not be destroyed?' Do not put it that way. Ask rather: 'Should we not destroy this man who is deceived and deluded about the most vital matters, who is blinded not in the eyes that distinguish white from black, but in the judgment that distinguishes Good from Evil?' If you state it this way, you will realize how inhumane your statement is—it is like saying, 'Should we not kill this blind man, or this deaf man?' For if the greatest harm is the loss of the greatest things, and the greatest thing in each person is a right moral purpose, and someone is deprived of this, why are you still angry with him? Man, if you must be affected by the misfortunes of others, pity him rather than hate him! Drop this readiness to take offense and this hatred.\n\nWhy, then, are we angry? Because we admire the materials of which they rob us. Listen to me: do not admire your clothes, and you will not be angry with the thief. Do not admire the beauty of a woman, and you will not be angry with the adulterer. Realize that a thief or an adulterer has no place among the things that are truly your own, but only among things that are alien to you and not under your control. If you dismiss these things and count them as nothing, with whom can you still be angry? But as long as you admire these externals, be angry with yourself rather than with them.\n\nConsider: you have beautiful clothes, and your neighbor does not. You have a window; you want to air them out. The neighbor does not know what the true good of man is; he imagines it is having beautiful clothes—the very same thing you imagine! Will he not come and take them? If you show a cake to gluttonous men and then eat it all yourself, do you not want them to snatch it? Do not provoke them! Do not have a window; do not air your clothes!\n\nI myself had an iron lamp recently by my household gods. I heard a noise at the window. I ran down and found the lamp stolen. I reasoned with myself: 'It seemed to him that he would gain by taking it.' What then? Tomorrow, I said, you will find a cheap clay one. For a man only loses what he has. 'I have lost my cloak.' Yes, because you had a cloak. 'I have a pain in my head.' Have you ever had a pain in your horns? No, because you do not have horns. Why then are you distressed? We must practice on small things and, beginning there, proceed to greater ones.\n\nWalk upright, relying on these doctrines, free, not relying on bulk of body like an athlete. For who is the invincible athlete? The one whom nothing outside his own reasoned choice can dismay. I look at him through every circumstance. 'He overcame the first difficulty.' What about the second? What if it is hot? What if he is drunk? What if he is asleep? That is my invincible athlete.",
    "notes": "This discourse is a masterclass in Stoic ethics and epistemology (the theory of knowledge). Epictetus argues for 'Socratic Intellectualism': the idea that no one does wrong willingly, but out of ignorance. A thief steals not because he wants to be 'evil,' but because his faculty of judgment is corrupted—he falsely assents to the impression that 'possessing this object is good.' Therefore, the appropriate response to vice is not anger (which is an emotional contraction of the soul) but pity, just as we pity the blind. Furthermore, Epictetus turns the mirror on the student: if you are angry at a thief, it proves that you still value the 'indifferents' (material goods) just as much as the thief does. You are both suffering from the same delusion—that happiness is found in clothes or lamps. The story of the iron lamp is a practical example of how a Stoic processes loss: acknowledging the determinism of the thief's action ('it seemed right to him') and immediately recognizing that moral character is the only true possession. The 'Invincible Athlete' is the ultimate Stoic ideal: a person who cannot be defeated because their victory condition lies entirely within their own reasoned choice (prohairesis), which no external force can touch.",

    "english": "Chapter 19: How we should behave towards tyrants.\n\nWhenever a man possesses some advantage—or thinks he possesses it when he does not—if he is uneducated, he is inevitably puffed up by it. The tyrant says immediately, 'I am the most powerful of all.' And where exactly is your power? Tell me. In a ship, do you trust in yourself or in the expert pilot? In a chariot? In whom do you trust, other than the expert driver? And how is it in the other arts? Exactly the same.\n\nWhat, then, can you actually do? 'Everyone pays court to me,' you say. Do I not also attend to my donkey? Do I not wash his feet? Do I not curry him? Do you not realize that every man pays court to himself, and serves you only as he serves his donkey? For who pays court to you as a man? Show me. who wishes to become like you? Who emulates you as they did Socrates?\n\n'But I can cut off your head,' you say. You are right. I had forgotten that I must pay court to you as I would to a fever or the cholera, and that I should raise an altar to you, just as there is an altar to Fever in Rome.\n\nWhat is it, then, that disturbs and terrifies the multitude? Is it the tyrant and his bodyguards? Heaven forbid! It is impossible for that which is by nature free to be disturbed or hindered by anything other than itself. No, it is a man's own judgements that disturb him. For when the tyrant says to a man, 'I will chain your leg,' the man who values his leg cries, 'No, have mercy!' But the man who values his will says, 'If it seems more profitable to you, chain it.'\n\n'Do you not care?'\n'I do not care.'\n'I will show you that I am master!'\n'How can you be my master? Zeus has set me free. Or do you really think he intended his own son to be enslaved? You are master of my carcass; take it.'\n\n'So when you approach me, do you not pay court to me?'\n'No, only to myself. If you wish me to say that I pay court to you also, I tell you that I do so only as I pay court to my water-pot.'\n\nThis is not selfishness; for the animal is so constituted that it does all things for its own sake. Even the sun does all things for its own sake, and for that matter, so does Zeus himself. But when Zeus wishes to be the Rain-giver and the Fruit-giver and the Father of Men and Gods, you see that he cannot achieve these works or earn these titles unless he is useful to the common interest. In general, he has so constituted the nature of the rational animal that he can attain nothing of his own good unless he contributes something to the common good. Thus, acting for one's own sake is no longer unsocial.\n\nFor what do you expect? That a man should desert himself and his own interest? How then can there remain one and the same principle of action for all—that of self-preservation?\n\nWhat happens, then? When absurd judgements concerning things that imply no choice are added to these principles, the situation becomes dangerous. 'I was useful to the tyrant, but the others were not.' And how does a man suddenly become wise simply because Caesar has appointed him to charge of the chamber pot? How is it that we suddenly say, 'Felicion spoke to me very wisely'? I would like to see him thrown off the dung-heap, so that you might think him a fool again.\n\nEpaphroditus owned a shoemaker whom he sold because he was useless. Then, by some chance, he was bought by one of Caesar's men and became Caesar's shoemaker. You should have seen how Epaphroditus honored him! 'How is the good Felicion doing?' he would ask. 'I love you like a brother.' And if someone asked, 'What is the master doing?' he was told, 'He is consulting with Felicion about something important.' Had he not sold him as useless? Who, then, suddenly made him wise? This is what it means to honor something other than the things within the sphere of choice.\n\nSomeone has been deemed worthy of a tribuneship. Who has ever offered a sacrifice for having desired purely, or for having directed his impulses according to nature? For we give thanks to the gods for those things wherein we place our good. Just today, a man was speaking to me about the priesthood of Augustus. I said to him: 'Man, let the thing go; you will spend much for nothing.'\n'But those who draw up contracts will write my name.'\n'Can you, then, stand by while men read it? And if you die, what will happen?'\n'My name will remain.'\n'Write it on a stone and it will remain just as well. Come now, outside of Nicopolis, who remembers you?'\n'But I shall wear a golden crown.'\n'If you have your heart set on a crown, take a wreath of roses and put it on; it will look much more elegant.'",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus attacks the source of our fear of authority and our obsession with status. The core lesson is the proper evaluation of power. A tyrant (or a boss, or a politician) only has power over 'externals'—the body, property, and freedom of movement (the 'carcass'). They have absolutely no power over the 'prohairesis' (the moral will), unless we voluntarily surrender it by fearing them.\n\nEpictetus uses the 'Dichotomy of Control' to dismantle the tyrant's threat. If the tyrant threatens to chain your leg, and you identify your 'self' with your leg, you are a slave. If you identify your 'self' with your moral choice, you remain free, telling the tyrant he only controls dead matter, not the living man.\n\nFurthermore, Epictetus explores 'Oikeiosis' (appropriation) regarding self-interest. He argues that it is natural to act for oneself, but for a rational, social animal, 'self-interest' and 'the common good' are inextricably linked. You cannot be a successful human (just as the sun cannot be the sun) without serving the whole. Finally, he mocks the vanity of office and titles (like the priesthood or being Caesar's shoemaker). We attribute wisdom and worth to people based on their proximity to power, which is a fundamental error in judgement. True worth is found in the character, not the crown.",

    "english": "Consider the nature of Reason and how it possesses the unique ability to contemplate itself. Every art and faculty is designed to contemplate certain specific objects. Now, when the faculty is of the same nature as the objects it studies, it necessarily contemplates itself; but when it is of a different nature, it cannot. For example, the art of shoemaking deals with hides, but the art itself is entirely distinct from the material of hides; therefore, it does not contemplate itself. Grammar deals with written speech; is grammar itself written speech? By no means. Therefore, it cannot contemplate itself. \n\nFor what purpose, then, have we received Reason from Nature? To make the right use of impressions. And what is Reason itself? It is a system composed of specific impressions. Thus, by its very nature, it turns back to contemplate itself. Again, what has wisdom come to inspect? Things good, bad, and indifferent. And what is wisdom itself? A good. And folly? A bad. Do you see, then, that wisdom necessarily contemplates both itself and its opposite? \n\nTherefore, the greatest and first task of the philosopher is this: to test the impressions and distinguish between them, and to admit none that has not been assayed. Look at how we handle coinage, where we believe we have a stake in the matter! We have invented a specific art for it; the silver-tester uses sight, touch, smell, and finally hearing. He throws the coin down and listens to the ring—not just once, but his great attention makes him a musician of the sound. \n\nYet, in matters where the difference lies between wandering in error and not wandering, here we apply no such attention! We stand gaping and snoring over our wretched ruling faculty, accepting every impression that comes along, simply because the damage is not immediately palpable to us. \n\nIf you wish to know how slack you are regarding good and evil, and how energetic regarding indifferent things, consider this: how do you feel about going blind versus being deceived in your judgments? You will realize you are far from feeling as you ought regarding good and evil. \n\n'But,' you say, 'this requires much preparation, much hard work, and study.' True. The primary doctrine of the philosophers is brief enough. Read Zeno and you will see. How long does it take to say: 'Our end is to follow the gods, and the essence of the good is the proper use of impressions'? But ask: 'What is God? What is an impression? What is individual nature and universal nature?' Now the discussion becomes long. \n\nIf Epicurus comes and says the good is in the flesh, the discussion again becomes lengthy. We must ask: What is the ruling principle in us? Is the good of the snail in the shell? No? Then is man's good in his body? And you, Epicurus, what is this superior thing inside you that deliberates, that examines everything, that writes books about the flesh? Why do you light a lamp and toil for us if we are just flesh? And so, the argument grows long.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus establishes the supremacy of the Rational Faculty (Logos). Unlike a hammer or the art of shoemaking, which cannot analyze themselves, Reason is a tool that operates on itself. It is a system of impressions used to evaluate impressions. This reflexive nature imposes a heavy responsibility: the 'Dokimasia' (testing/assaying) of our thoughts. Epictetus uses the metaphor of the 'Argyrognomon' (the silver-tester or coin-assayer) to shame his students. We use immense rigor to detect fake money because we value wealth, yet we are 'asleep' and 'gaping' when it comes to testing the truth of the impressions entering our minds, even though a false judgment damages our very self (the Hegemonikon). He concludes by noting that while Stoic maxims are short ('Follow Nature'), the supporting logic requires deep study (physics, theology, and logic) to refute errors like Epicureanism, which absurdly uses Reason to argue that the flesh is superior to Reason.",

If one truly values reason and nature, the applause of the irrational is meaningless.

    "english": "On Preconceptions. Preconceptions are common to all men, and one preconception does not contradict another. For who among us does not assume that the Good is beneficial and something to be chosen, and that we must pursue and follow it in every circumstance? Who does not assume that the Just is honorable and fitting? When, then, does conflict arise? It arises in the application of preconceptions to particular substances. When one person says, 'He acted well, he is brave,' and another says, 'No, he is crazy.' Here lies the conflict of Jews, Syrians, Egyptians, and Romans; not over whether holiness should be preferred above all else and pursued in every instance, but over whether it is holy to eat pork or unholy. You will find this same conflict between Agamemnon and Achilles. Call them into the center. What do you say, Agamemnon? Should not that which is right and proper be done? 'It should indeed.' And what of you, Achilles? Does it not please you that what is right be done? 'It pleases me most of all.' Then apply these preconceptions! One says, 'I ought not to return Chryseis to her father.' The other says, 'You certainly ought to.' It is here that the conflict arises. What, then, is it to be educated? It is to learn to apply natural preconceptions to particular cases in accordance with nature, and, for the rest, to distinguish that of things that exist, some are in our power and some are not. In our power are the will and all acts of the will; not in our power are the body, the parts of the body, possessions, parents, brothers, children, country—simply put, our associates. Where, then, shall we place the Good? To what kind of substance shall we apply it? To that which is in our power? 'But then,' you say, 'is not health a good, and wholeness, and life? And are not children, parents, and country good?' If you say this, who will tolerate you? Let us transfer the Good to these external things. Is it then possible for one to be happy while being harmed and failing to obtain good things? 'It is not possible.' And can one maintain the proper conduct toward one's associates? For I am naturally formed to look after my own interest. If it is in my interest to have a farm, it is in my interest to take it from my neighbor. If it is in my interest to have a cloak, it is in my interest to steal it from the bathhouse. From this source come wars, seditions, tyrannies, and plots. And how shall I still be able to fulfill my duty toward Zeus? For if I am harmed and unfortunate, He pays no attention to me. And what is He to me if He cannot help me? What is He to me if He wishes me to be in the state I am in? Why then do we make temples, why statues to Zeus, as if to evil spirits, as to Fever? And how is He strictly the Savior, the Rain-giver, the Fruit-bringer? And surely, if we place the essence of the Good in external things, all these consequences follow. What, then, shall we do? This is the inquiry of the true philosopher who is in labor with thought: 'Now I do not see what the Good and the Evil are. Am I mad? Yes. But if I place the Good here, in the things of the will, everyone will laugh at me.' Some gray-haired old man with many gold rings will come and shake his head, saying, 'Listen to me, child: one must philosophize, but one must also have brains. These things are foolish. You learn syllogisms from philosophers, but what you ought to do, you know better than the philosophers.' What shall I say to this slave? If I remain silent, he bursts. So I must say, 'Forgive me, as you would lovers; I am not my own master, I am mad.'",
    "notes": "This discourse defines the core intellectual failure of humanity: the inability to correctly apply 'preconceptions' (prolepsis) to 'particular cases' (epibole). We all naturally understand abstract concepts like Good, Just, or Holy. The chaos of the world—including the Trojan War or religious strife—arises not from ignorance of the definition of 'Good,' but from mistakenly attaching that label to externals (like pork, status, or women). Epictetus emphasizes that true education means learning to place the label 'Good' only on what is within our control (prohairesis/moral choice). If we attach 'Good' to externals (health, property, family), we inevitably become thieves, warmongers, and blasphemers against the Gods, because our self-interest will clash with others and with Fortune. Finally, Epictetus highlights the social cost of wisdom: the philosopher will be mocked by the 'sensible' materialistic world (represented by the rich old man) and must accept being viewed as 'mad' by the ignorant majority.",

    "english": "Even Epicurus realizes that we are, by nature, social beings. But once he has located our 'Good' in the husk—that is, the body—he can say nothing else. For he holds fast to the principle that one must not admire or accept anything separated from the nature of the Good; and he holds to this consistently. But tell me, how can we be social beings if we possess no natural affection for our offspring? Why do you, Epicurus, advise the wise man not to raise children? Why do you fear he will fall into sorrow on their account? Does he fall into sorrow over the mouse being fed in his house? What does he care if a little mouse cries inside? No! Epicurus knows that once a child is born, it is no longer in our power not to love it or care for it. For this same reason, he says that a man of sense will not engage in politics; for he knows what a politician must do. If you intend to live among men as if they were flies, indeed, what prevents you? But knowing these things, he still dares to say that we should not rear children. What do you want? That we should be as foolish as sheep? Yet even they do not abandon their young! Or as savage as wolves? Even they do not abandon them! Come now, who would listen to you if he saw his own child fallen on the ground and weeping? I believe that even if your own mother and father had predicted you were going to say these things, they still would not have cast you out!",
    "notes": "Epictetus highlights the fundamental contradiction in Epicurean philosophy. While Epicurus admits humans are social animals, his definition of the 'Good' as bodily pleasure (or absence of pain) forces him to reject the responsibilities of family and state, as these bring potential for distress. Epictetus argues that natural affection (philostorgia) is an invincible law of nature. We are not designed to live like isolated 'flies.' The Stoic lesson is that you cannot intellectualize away your humanity; to deny your duty to care for others is to sink below the level of even wild beasts. True freedom is found not in avoiding relationships to escape pain, but in fulfilling our roles as parents and citizens with virtue.",

    "english": "How must we struggle against difficulties? It is difficulties that show what men are! Therefore, when a difficulty falls upon you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has matched you with a rough young opponent. 'For what purpose?' you ask. So that you may become an Olympic conqueror; but this cannot be done without sweat. In my estimation, no one has had a better difficulty provided to them than you have, if only you are willing to use it as an athlete uses a young sparring partner.\n\nEven now, we are sending you to Rome as a spy. But no one sends a cowardly spy, who, if he only hears a noise or sees a shadow, runs back in terror and reports that the enemy is already here. So if you go now and tell us, 'Things are fearful in Rome; death is terrible, exile is terrible, slander is terrible, poverty is terrible; run, men, the enemy is near!' we will answer you: 'Get away, go prophesy to yourself! Our only mistake was sending such a spy.'\n\nDiogenes, who was sent as a spy before you, reported back to us very differently. He says that death is no evil, for it is not shameful; he says that bad reputation is merely the noise of madmen. And what a report this spy gave us about pain, about pleasure, and about poverty! He says, 'Being naked is better than any purple robe; sleeping on the bare ground is the softest bed.' And he brings as proof of each point his own courage, his tranquility, his freedom, and even his body, gleaming and well-knit. 'There is no enemy near,' he says, 'all is full of peace.' That is what a spy ought to be; but you come to us saying one thing after another in confusion. Will you not go back and look more accurately, putting aside your cowardice?\n\n'What, then, shall I do?'\n\nWhat do you do when you leave a ship? Do you carry away the rudder or the oars? No. What then do you take? You take what is your own: your oil flask and your wallet. So now, if you remember what is your own, you will never claim what belongs to others. The tyrant says to you, 'Hand over your broad-striped senator's robe.' 'Here is the broad stripe.' 'Hand over this tunic also.' 'Here is the tunic.' 'Look, now you are naked.' 'But you have excited my envy.' 'Then take my whole body!' 'But I will not leave you an heir.' 'What then? Did I forget that none of these things were mine?'\n\nHow, then, do we call them ours? Just as we call the bed in an inn ours. If the innkeeper dies and leaves you the beds, well and good; but if he leaves them to another, that man will have them, and you will seek another bed. If you do not find one, you will sleep on the ground; only keep up your spirits and snore, remembering that tragedies have their place among the rich and kings and tyrants, but no poor man fills a role in a tragedy, except as one of the chorus.\n\nKings begin with prosperity: 'Crown the palace with garlands.' But then, roughly: 'O Cithaeron, why didst thou receive me?' Do their bodyguards save them? When, therefore, you approach any of these great men, remember this: that you are approaching a tragic actor—not the actor, but Oedipus himself. 'But such a man is happy,' you say, 'for he walks with a great entourage.' I join myself to the crowd and I, too, walk with many.\n\nBut the main point is this: Remember that the door is open. Do not be more cowardly than children, but just as they say, when the game no longer pleases them, 'I will play no more,' so you too, when things seem to you to be such, say, 'I will play no more,' and leave; but if you stay, do not complain.",
    "notes": "This discourse contains some of Epictetus' most vivid imagery regarding the Stoic attitude toward adversity and suicide. \n\n1. **The Wrestler (Adversity as Training):** Epictetus reframes hardship not as bad luck, but as divine 'matching.' Just as a coach pairs a wrestler with a strong opponent to toughen him, God sends difficulties to strengthen our moral character ('prohairesis'). Without the 'sweat' of struggle, virtue remains untested and weak.\n\n2. **The Spy/Scout (Correct Judgment):** The philosopher is compared to a scout sent into the world to determine what is truly dangerous. The 'cowardly spy' (the non-Stoic) reports that external things (death, poverty, pain) are enemies. The 'true spy' (Diogenes/the Stoic) reports the truth: these things are indifferent ('adiaphora') and the only true enemy is our own false judgment and lack of self-control.\n\n3. **The Inn & The Ship (Ownership):** These metaphors reinforce the dichotomy of control. We are travelers in life. Our bodies, status, and possessions are like the furniture in a hotel or equipment on a ship—we use them while we are there, but we do not own them. When the 'innkeeper' (God/Fate) reclaims them, we must let go without struggle, because they were never truly ours.\n\n4. **The Open Door (Suicide):** This is the ultimate Stoic reassurance. We are never truly trapped by tyrants or circumstances because we always possess the freedom to leave life. This is not a call to rash suicide, but a reminder of power. If a situation is truly unbearable (preventing virtuous living), one can depart ('I will play no more'). However, if one chooses to stay, one implies the situation is bearable, and thus, complaining is contradictory and childish.",

    "english": "On the same subject. If these doctrines are true—and we are not merely trifling or playing the hypocrite when we say that the Good and the Bad for man lie in the sphere of moral choice, while all other things are nothing to us—why are we still troubled? Why are we still afraid? No one has authority over the things we truly care about; and the things over which others have authority, we do not care about. What kind of issue remains? \n\n'But give me a command,' you say. \n\nWhat command should I give you? Has not Zeus commanded you? Has He not given you what is yours to be unhindered and unconstrained, and what is not yours to be subject to hindrance and constraint? What other command did you bring from Him when you came here? What order? 'Guard what is yours by every means; do not lust after what belongs to others.' Faithfulness is yours; modesty is yours. Who can take these away? Who can hinder you from using them but yourself? And how do you hinder yourself? Only when you crave what is not your own.\n\nWith such instructions and commands from Zeus, what further orders do you want from me? Am I greater than He? More trustworthy? If you keep His commands, do you need any others? 'But has He not given these orders?' Bring forward your preconceptions! Bring forward the proofs of the philosophers! Bring forward what you have often heard, what you have said yourself, what you have read, what you have practiced!\n\n'How long, then, is it right to observe these things?'\n\nAs long as the game is played gracefully. Look at the Saturnalia: the lot designates a King of the festival. He decides to play the game. He orders: 'You, drink! You, mix the wine! You, sing! You, go away! You, come here!' I obey, so as not to break the game. But then he says, 'You, assume that you are in a wretched state.' I reply: 'I will not assume that.' Was that in the game? \n\nAgain, we agree to play out the story of Agamemnon and Achilles. He who has been assigned Agamemnon says to me: 'Go to Achilles and drag away Briseis.' I go. 'Let it be night.' It is night. 'Now, assume you are miserable.' No! I will not. So it is here. 'Let it be that you are unlucky.' Is it so? Am I truly unlucky? 'Let it be that you are wretched.' But I will only assume the role, not the internal wretchedness.\n\n'How long must we obey such people?'\n\nAs long as it is profitable; that is, as long as I can preserve what is fitting and consistent. \n\nConsider this: some people are sour-tempered and easily nauseated. They say, 'I cannot dine with that man; I have to endure him telling me every day how he fought in Mysia: \"I told you, brother, how I climbed the hill...\" I prefer not to eat.' Another says, 'I would rather dine and let him babble as much as he likes.' You must compare these values for yourself. Only do nothing as one burdened, do nothing as one afflicted, and do not think yourself into misery; for no one compels you to that.\n\nHas someone made smoke in the room? If it is moderate, I will stay; if it is excessive, I go out. For you must remember and hold fast to this: the door is open. \n\n'Do not live in Nicopolis.' I will not. 'Nor in Athens.' I will not live in Athens. 'Nor in Rome.' I will not live in Rome. 'Live in Gyara.' I will live in Gyara. But living in Gyara seems to me like a great smoke. I depart to a place where no one can stop me from dwelling—for that dwelling is open to all. \n\nAs for the last tunic—that is, this poor body—beyond that, no one has any power over me. This is why Demetrius said to Nero: 'You threaten me with death, but Nature threatens you.' If I marvel at the poor body, I have surrendered myself as a slave; if I marvel at my little property, I am a slave. For immediately, I disclose to the tyrant where I can be caught; I show him what to strike. \n\nRemembering this, whom will you flatter? Of whom will you be afraid? \n\n'But I want to sit where the Senators sit.'\n\nDo you see that you are creating a tight squeeze for yourself? You are squeezing yourself!\n\n'But how else shall I see the show properly in the amphitheater?'\n\nMan! Do not watch, and you will not be squeezed. Why do you make trouble for yourself? Or wait a little, and when the show is over, sit in the Senators' seats and sun yourself. For remember this general rule: we squeeze ourselves, we cramp ourselves; that is, our own judgments squeeze and cramp us. \n\nFor what is it to be reviled? Stand by a stone and revile it; what will you achieve? If a man listens like a stone, what advantage has the reviler? But if the reviler has the weakness of the victim as a stepping-stone, then he accomplishes something. Strip him of that handle. 'I have insulted you.' The philosophers say these things are paradoxes. Is it so surprising if in philosophy, as in other arts, many truths seem paradoxical to the inexperienced?",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus addresses the practical application of the dichotomy of control to social life and perceived hardships. The central theme is the maintenance of internal freedom regardless of external circumstances.\n\n1. **The Game of Life (Role-playing):** Epictetus uses the metaphors of the Saturnalia festival and theatrical plays. We accept the roles assigned to us by fate or social context (obeying the 'King' of the game) and perform the necessary actions (fetching Briseis, mixing wine). However, there is a hard limit: we must never assent to a false judgment about our own moral state. The world can command our actions, but it cannot command us to believe we are 'wretched' or 'evil.'\n\n2. **The Open Door (The Smoke Metaphor):** This is one of Epictetus's most famous analogies regarding suicide and tolerance. Life is like a room. If there is 'smoke' (hardships, annoying people, tyranny), we calculate the cost. If the smoke is moderate, we stay and endure it for the sake of other benefits (like dinner or life itself). If the smoke becomes stifling (compromising our moral integrity), we leave. The 'door is open' means we are never truly trapped because death is always an available exit. This knowledge paradoxically allows us to live without fear.\n\n3. **Self-Inflicted Suffering:** The student who complains about not seeing the show from the Senator's seats is 'squeezing' himself. Epictetus teaches that anxiety does not come from the crowd, but from the judgment that 'I must sit there.' By removing the desire for status (an external), the constriction vanishes.\n\n4. **Invulnerability:** The body is described as merely the 'last tunic.' If we detach our identity from our body and possessions, the tyrant has nothing to strike. The reference to Demetrius underscores that the Stoic fears no human threat, as even the tyrant is mortal.",

    "english": "What is the law of life? When one of my students was reading about hypothetical arguments, I interrupted him: 'The law in hypothetical arguments is to accept what follows logically from the premise. But the law of life is far more ancient: it is to act in accordance with Nature. If we wish to maintain harmony with Nature in every circumstance and matter, it is clear that we must always aim to neither miss the logical consequence nor admit anything contradictory to it.'\n\nThis is why philosophers train us first in the sphere of logic—it is easier there. In logic, there are no distractions pulling us away from what we are taught. But in the matters of life? There are many distractions. It is ridiculous, therefore, for a student to say he wants to begin with the practical matters immediately; it is not easy to begin with the hardest tasks.\n\nThis is the defense you should present to parents who are angry that their children are studying philosophy: 'So, father, I am making mistakes and I do not know what is incumbent upon me or fitting. If this cannot be learned or taught, why do you blame me? But if it can be taught, then teach me! And if you cannot, allow me to learn from those who say they know. What do you think? That I intentionally fall into evil and miss the good? God forbid. What, then, is the cause of my error? Ignorance. Do you not want me, then, to put away this ignorance?'\n\nHowever, only a person with the right intention and capacity can speak this way.\n\nConsider the man who just wants to show off at a dinner party that he knows hypothetical syllogisms. He reads these texts and visits philosophers merely for display. But the real stakes are elsewhere; the wealth we value here seems like mere toys to the philosopher. That is why it is difficult to master one's impressions in real life, where the things that shake us seem so huge.\n\nI know a man who fell weeping at the knees of Epaphroditus, claiming he was in misery and starving, simply because he had nothing left but one and a half million drachmas! And what did Epaphroditus do? Did he laugh at him like you are laughing? No. He looked at him with amazement and said, 'Poor man, how then have you kept silence? How have you endured it?'\n\n(Epictetus then scolded the teacher who was laughing while reading): You are laughing at yourself! You did not prepare this young student properly; you did not determine if he was capable of following these arguments. You treat him merely as a reader.\n\nListen: If a mind cannot follow a complex argument, do we trust its praise? Do we trust its blame? Do we trust its judgment on what is done well or badly? If such a person speaks ill of someone, does the victim care? If he praises someone, is the recipient elated? No, because this judge cannot even find the logical sequence in small matters.\n\nThis, then, is the beginning of philosophy: a perception of the state of one's own ruling faculty. For once a man realizes that his mind is weak, he will no longer wish to use it for great matters immediately. But now, some of you who cannot even swallow a mouthful of bread buy a whole treatise and try to devour it. Consequently, you vomit. Then come the colics, the fluxes, and the fevers. You ought to have considered first whether you had the capacity.\n\nIn theory, it is easy to refute someone who does not know what they are talking about. But in the affairs of life, no one offers themselves to be tested, and we hate the person who tries to test us. Yet, as Socrates used to say: 'The unexamined life is not worth living.'",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus draws a sharp parallel between the laws of logic and the laws of life. In logic, if you accept a premise, you are bound by its conclusion (consequence); you cannot hold contradictory views. The 'Law of Life' is strictly analogous: to live successfully, one's actions must follow logically from the nature of a rational, social being (Nature). Inconsistency in action is as structurally fatal to a good life as a contradiction is to a logical argument.\n\nEpictetus emphasizes pedagogical progression. We start with logic (the classroom) because it is a sterile environment without the 'distractions' of heavy emotions, money, or reputation. Life is the advanced class because external impressions (phantasiai) are powerful and seductive. He uses the absurd example of the rich man crying over 'poverty' to show how distorted our value judgments are without training.\n\nThe core practical lesson is the 'diagnosis of the Ruling Faculty' (Hegemonikon). Before attempting great philosophical feats or complex life decisions, one must assess the strength of their own mind. Trying to swallow advanced philosophy without the preliminary mental strength leads to 'spiritual indigestion'—arrogance, confusion, and failure. The true philosopher, like Socrates, constantly examines their own life, even though society hates to be tested.",

    "english": "Impressions come to us in four ways: either things exist and appear to exist; or they do not exist and do not appear to exist; or they exist but do not appear to; or they do not exist but appear to. Now, to hit the mark in all these cases is the work of an educated man. Whatever the specific source of your distress, you must apply the specific remedy against it. If sophisms of the Pyrrhonists and Academics trouble us, let us apply the remedy of logic. If it is the persuasiveness of external things—making things appear good when they are not—let us seek the remedy there. If habit is the burden, we must try to find the remedy against that. \n\nWhat, then, is the remedy for habit? The contrary habit. You hear the ignorant masses saying, 'Wretched man, he is dead! His father perished, and his mother too! Cut down prematurely and in a foreign land!' Listen to the contrary arguments; tear yourself away from these voices; oppose the habit with a counter-habit. Against sophistical arguments, we have logic and our training in reasoning; against the persuasive appearance of things, we must have our preconceptions scoured clean and ready to hand. \n\nWhen death appears to be an evil, have this ready: it is our duty to avoid evils, yet death is necessary and inevitable. What am I to do? Where shall I flee? Let me be like Sarpedon, the son of Zeus, so that I may speak as nobly as he: 'I go either to achieve distinction myself or to give another the opportunity to achieve it.' If I cannot succeed myself, I will not begrudge another the chance to do something noble. Where can I flee death? Show me the country, show me the people to whom I may go where death does not visit! Show me a magic charm against it! If I have none, what do you want me to do? I cannot escape death; but can I not escape the fear of it? Must I die lamenting and trembling? \n\nFor this is the very origin of suffering (pathos): to wish for something and not obtain it. If I can change externals to suit my will, I do so; if not, I want to tear out the eyes of the one hindering me. For man is naturally constituted not to endure being deprived of the good or falling into the evil. And finally, when I can neither change the situation nor blind the hinderer, I sit and groan and abuse God. 'If He does not care for me,' I say, 'what is He to me?' \n\n'But,' you say, 'you will be impious.' Let the Pyrrhonist and the Academic philosophers come and face me. For my part, I have no leisure for these matters, nor can I argue on behalf of common sense. If I had a lawsuit about a small plot of land, I would call another to advocate for me. With what am I satisfied here? That perception occurs. Do you ask how? Even those who deny the senses act according to them. Who among you, wanting to go to the bathhouse, ever went to the mill instead? \n\n'What then? Ought we not to do our best to uphold the validity of the senses and stand guard against attacks on them?' Who is stopping you? But let the man who has the leisure and the ability do it. The man who is trembling, confused, and whose heart is breaking within him has more urgent business to attend to than theoretical debates.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus categorizes the epistemological challenges a student faces and prioritizes practical therapy over theoretical debate. \n\n1. **The Fourfold Impressions**: He begins by outlining the four ways reality and appearance intersect. The Stoic goal is accurate assent—aligning one's judgment with reality.\n\n2. **The Counter-Habit**: Epictetus introduces a crucial psychological tool. We are conditioned by the 'ignorant masses' (idiōtai) to view death and externals as tragic. Logic alone is insufficient to break this conditioning; one must cultivate a 'contrary habit' (enantion ethos) by actively listening to and repeating Stoic refutations whenever these impressions arise.\n\n3. **The Definition of Passion**: He provides a strict definition of passion (pathos) as 'wishing for something and not obtaining it.' Suffering is not caused by the event (death), but by the friction between one's desire (to live forever) and inevitable reality (mortality). \n\n4. **Prioritizing the Cure**: The discourse ends with a dismissal of Academic Skepticism (which questioned the validity of the senses). While Epictetus acknowledges the theoretical debate, he argues that for the student who is still 'trembling and broken'—meaning, still enslaved by passion and anxiety—engaging in abstract epistemology is a distraction. You do not need to prove the bathhouse exists to go there; you need to cure your fear of death. Heal the soul first; argue philosophy later.",

    "english": "What is the reason we give our assent to anything? Because it appears to be true. It is impossible to assent to what appears false. Why? Because this is the very nature of the intellect: to nod to the truth, to be dissatisfied with falsehood, and to suspend judgment on the uncertain. What is the proof of this? Try, if you can, to believe right now that it is night. You cannot. Try to disbelieve that it is day. You cannot. Try to believe or disbelieve that the number of stars is even. You cannot. Therefore, when someone assents to a falsehood, know that he did not wish to assent to a lie—for 'every soul is deprived of the truth against its will,' as Plato says—but rather, the lie appeared to him to be the truth.\n\nNow, apply this to action. What corresponds here to truth and falsehood? Duty and what is contrary to duty; the advantageous and the disadvantageous; what is appropriate to me and what is not. Can a man think something is advantageous to him and yet choose not to do it? He cannot. 'But,' you say, 'what about the woman who says: \"I know what evil I am about to do, but passion overrules my reason\"?' She thinks that satisfying her anger is more advantageous than avoiding the evil. She is deceived. If you show her clearly that she is mistaken, she will not do it; but as long as you do not show her, she has nothing to follow but her own impression.\n\nWhy, then, are you angry with her? Because this poor woman has been led astray regarding the most important matters and has become a viper instead of a human being? Should you not rather pity her? As we pity the blind and the lame, so should we pity those who are blinded and crippled in their governing faculties. Whoever remembers this clearly—that for man the measure of every action is the impression (if it appears good, he is beyond blame; if bad, he pays the penalty, for one man cannot be deceived while another suffers the harm)—will never be angry with anyone, never hate anyone, never reproach, blame, or offend anyone.\n\n'So,' you ask, 'do such great and terrible deeds originate from this alone—from an impression?' Yes, from this and nothing else. The Iliad is nothing but an impression and the use of impressions. It appeared to Paris to carry off the wife of Menelaus; it appeared to Helen to follow him. If it had appeared to Menelaus that it was a gain to be deprived of such a wife, what would have happened? You would have lost not only the Iliad but the Odyssey as well. 'Do such great matters depend on such a small thing?' What do you mean by 'great matters'? Wars, factions, the destruction of many men, and the razing of cities? What is great about that? Nothing. 'What?' you cry. 'Is it not great when many oxen and sheep die, and many nests of swallows or storks are burned and destroyed?' 'Are these things similar to the others?' Most similar! The bodies of men are destroyed, and so are the bodies of oxen and sheep. The dwellings of men are burned, and so are the nests of storks. What is great or terrible in this? Show me how the house of a man differs from the nest of a stork as a dwelling. 'Is a stork, then, like a man?' What are you saying? In respect to the body, most like him. But in respect to making houses of beams and tiles versus sticks and mud, they differ.\n\n'Where, then, does a man differ from a stork?' Seek and you will find precisely where the difference lies. Look to see if it is not in understanding what he does, in sociability, in fidelity, in honor, in prudence. Where, then, is the great good and evil for man? Exactly where the difference is! If this distinct element is preserved and remains fortified, and if his honor, fidelity, and prudence are not destroyed, then the man himself is saved. But if any of these are lost or stormed, then the man is destroyed. And this is where the 'great events' truly lie.\n\nAlexander did not fall when his enemies say he did; for no one falls by the actions of another. That was merely the burning of stork's nests. He fell when he lost the character of a modest man, a faithful man, a hospitable man. When did Achilles fall? When Patroclus died? God forbid. He fell when he gave way to anger, when he wept for a girl, when he forgot that he was there not to acquire lovers but to make war. These are the true falls of men; this is the siege, this is the razing of the city: when right judgments are overthrown, when these are destroyed.\n\n'But when women are carried off and children led into captivity and men are slaughtered—are these not evils?' How do you add this opinion? Teach me. 'No, you tell me how they are not evils!' Let us go to the standards; produce your preconceptions. I cannot be sufficiently astonished at what happens here. When we want to judge weights, we do not judge at random; when we judge straight and crooked, we do not do it at random. In short, wherever it makes a difference to know the truth, no one acts at random. But where the first and only cause of acting right or wrong, of flowing smoothly or roughly, of failure or success is concerned—there alone are we reckless and rash. We have nothing like a scale, nothing like a standard. Assuming something appears a certain way, I immediately act on it. Am I better than Agamemnon or Achilles, that they should do and suffer such evils by following their impressions, but the impression acts well enough for me? Is there any tragedy that has a different beginning? What is the Atreus of Euripides? An impression. What is the Oedipus of Sophocles? An impression. The Phoenix? The Hippolytus? All impressions. What do you call those who follow every impression? Madmen. Are we, then, acting any differently?",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus provides a rigorous examination of Stoic epistemology and its application to ethics and emotional resilience. The core argument rests on the Stoic concept of 'assent' (synkatathesis). We do not have free will over whether a proposition appears true or false; the mind naturally bows to truth. Therefore, moral error is not a result of a 'sinful will' preferring evil, but an intellectual error—a deception where the vicious act 'appears' advantageous (good) to the agent at that moment.\n\nPractical takeaways include:\n\n1. **The Cure for Anger:** Since all bad behavior stems from ignorance (a false impression of what is good), the appropriate response to a wrongdoer is pity, not anger. They are 'blind' in their ruling faculty. We must treat them as we would the physically disabled—with compassion rather than hatred.\n\n2. **The Definition of 'Greatness':** Epictetus brutally deconstructs the scale of human tragedy. He argues that physical destruction (wars, death, burning cities) is morally indifferent (adiaphora). A man dying is biologically no different from a stork dying. To treat physical loss as a catastrophe is a category error.\n\n3. **The Real Citadel:** The only true 'destruction' or 'siege' happens within the *Prohairesis* (moral character). A man is only ruined when he loses his distinct human virtues: fidelity, modesty, and prudence. Achilles' tragedy was not the death of his friend, but the loss of his own emotional self-control.\n\n4. **The Tyranny of Impressions:** Most people live as 'madmen,' reacting immediately to unexamined impressions (phantasiai) without testing them against a standard (kanon). The Stoic student must pause and interrogate appearances before acting, rather than letting the mere appearance of events dictate their reality.",

    "english": "On Constancy (Steadfastness). \n\nWhat is the essence of the Good? It is a reasoned choice in a specific state. And of Evil? A reasoned choice in a specific state. What, then, are externals? They are merely the raw materials for the reasoned choice; in working with them, the choice will discover its own good or evil. How will it find the good? By not marveling at the materials! For if judgments about the materials are correct, they make the choice good; if twisted and distorted, they make it bad. God has enacted this law and declares: 'If you want anything good, get it from yourself!' You say: 'No, I will get it from another.' Do not be foolish. \n\nSo, when a tyrant threatens and does not invite me to dinner, I ask: Who is he threatening? 'I will chain you!' He threatens my hands and feet. 'I will behead you!' He threatens my neck. 'I will throw you in prison!' He threatens my whole wretched body. Does he, then, threaten *me*? If I feel that these things are nothing to me, he threatens nothing of mine. But if I fear any of them, then yes, he threatens me. Who remains for me to fear? The master of what? Of things in my control? No one is master of that. Of things not in my control? Why should I care about those?\n\n'So,' you ask, 'do you philosophers teach us to despise kings?' Heaven forbid. Which of us teaches you to claim against them the authority they actually possess? Take my body, take my property, take my reputation, take those around me. If I persuade anyone to claim these things against you, accuse me indeed. 'Yes,' the king says, 'but I also want to command your judgments.' And I reply: You cannot conquer a judgment that is not yours. 'I will bring fear upon you and conquer you.' You are mistaken. It is not I whom you conquer, but my body or my fear.\n\nThis is why God’s law is the strongest and most just: 'Let the stronger always prevail over the weaker.' Ten are stronger than one. In what way? In lifting weights, in force, in dragging. But can ten conquer a correct judgment? Impossible. This is why Socrates could not be conquered by the Athenians. 'You slave, what do you mean by Socrates?' Speak of the matter as it is: the wretched body of Socrates was dragged off to prison by stronger men; the hemlock was given to the wretched body of Socrates, and that body grew cold. Do these things seem marvelous to you? Unjust? Do you blame God for this? Did Socrates have nothing in return? Where was his essence of the Good? Whom shall we listen to, you or him? And what does he say? 'Anytus and Meletus can kill me, but they cannot harm me.'\n\nShow me that someone with inferior judgments can overpower someone who is superior in judgments. You cannot show it; it is impossible. For this is the law of nature and of God: 'Let the superior always prevail over the inferior.' In what? In that wherein it is superior. Body is stronger than body; the many are stronger than the one; the thief is stronger than the man who does not steal. That is why I lost my lamp the other day: because in the matter of keeping awake, the thief was superior to me. But he paid a price for that lamp: for a lamp, he became a thief; for a lamp, he became faithless; for a lamp, he became beast-like. And he thought he was gaining!\n\nSomeone seizes my cloak and drags me to the marketplace. Others shout, 'Philosopher, what good have your judgments done you? Look, you are being dragged to prison! Look, you are about to be beheaded!' And what kind of introduction to philosophy did I practice? Did I practice so that a stronger man could not seize my cloak? Did I practice so that ten men could not drag me to prison? No! I learned so that, whatever happens, I might see that if it is outside my reasoned choice, it is nothing to me. Have I not gained benefit from this? Why do you seek benefit in something other than what I learned?\n\nSo, sitting in prison, I say: 'This man shouting at me neither understands the signal nor follows what is said; he does not care to know what philosophers say or do. Let him be.' But surely, I must leave the prison? Until when? Until reason chooses for me to be with the body. But when reason does not choose it? Then take the body and good health to you! Only do not depart irrationally, nor faintly, nor for a trivial excuse. For God does not wish that; He has need of such a world and such inhabitants moving upon the earth. But if He sounds the recall signal, as He did for Socrates, one must obey the signaler as one obeys a general.\n\nShould we say these things to the mob? Why? Is it not enough for you to be convinced yourself? When children come clapping and saying, 'Today is the good Saturnalia,' do we say, 'These things are not good'? No, we clap along with them. So, when you cannot persuade a man, realize he is a child and clap with him; or if you cannot bear to do that, simply keep silent.\n\nRemember this: when called to a crisis, know that the time has come to prove whether we have been educated. A young man leaving school for a crisis is like a student practicing syllogisms; if someone offers him an easy one, he says, 'Give me a tangled knot so I can exercise myself!' Yet when life offers a knot, you complain, 'It is too heavy.' I would like to sail just to see this: how my athlete acts, how he practices his subject. Do not say, 'I do not want this subject.' It is yours to handle what is given, not to choose the task. 'Do not propose such a terrifying argument to me,' you say. No! The actor is not the mask or the robes. If stripped of the buskins and mask, does the tragic actor remain? If he keeps his voice, he remains. So it is here. 'Take the command.' I take it. 'Take the rags and come forward in this role.' I come forward. 'Now bear witness for me.'\n\nWhat witness do you give to God? 'I am in danger, Lord, I am unfortunate; no one cares for me; everyone blames me.' Is this the witness you will give, disgracing the summons He gave you, that He honored you with such a post? But the judge says, 'I judge you to be impious and unholy.' You reply: 'I have been judged impious and unholy.' Nothing more? Nothing. If he judged 'It is day' to be a lie, who is deceived? The judge. So who has the power to pronounce on you? Does he know what is holy or unholy? Has he studied it? Where? From whom? A musician does not care if a non-musician judges the high note to be the low note. Will the man educated in truth care about an uneducated man judging what is holy or unjust?\n\nLook, the books of the Stoics are full of logic, but where is the man who will testify to the words with actions? Take up this role for me! Let us stop using old examples in the school; let us have an example from our own time. Who is there to spectate these things? The man who has leisure. But it is shameful to spectate like runaway slaves—looking around nervously while applauding the actor. It is shameful for philosophers to contemplate the works of nature this way. What is a 'Master'? No man is master of another man; only death, life, pleasure, and pain are masters. Bring Caesar to me without these things, and you will see my steadfastness. But if he comes with thunder and lightning, and I fear them, have I not recognized my master like the runaway slave? As long as I have no truce with these things, I am like the runaway: I wash, I drink, I sing, but all with fear and misery. But if I liberate myself from the masters—that is, from the things that make men into masters—what trouble do I have? What master remains?",
    "notes": "1. **The Essence of Good and Evil:** Epictetus begins with the foundational Stoic doctrine that Good and Evil reside solely in the *prohairesis* (moral purpose/will). External things (health, wealth, reputation, the body itself) are *hylai* (indifferent raw materials). Virtue is the art of using these materials correctly.\n\n2. **The Tyrant's Paradox:** The lecture deconstructs the power of tyrants. A tyrant can only control external 'indifferents' (the body, property, life). If the Stoic detaches their identity from these husks, the tyrant loses all leverage. To fear the tyrant is to mistakenly identify the 'Self' with the 'Body.'\n\n3. **The Price of Vice (The Lamp):** Epictetus uses the famous anecdote of his stolen lamp to illustrate the cost of vice. The victim loses a material object (a trivial loss), but the thief loses their integrity and honor (the ultimate loss). This reinforces that the 'winner' of an injustice is actually the loser in moral terms.\n\n4. **Life as a Drama (Theatrum Mundi):** We are actors on a stage. God (the playwright/director) assigns the roles (poor man, cripple, prisoner). Our duty is not to choose the role but to play it with excellence. The 'voice' (reason) is the actor's true self, not the 'mask' or 'robes' (status/body).\n\n5. **The Witness (Martyrdom):** Hardship is not a misfortune; it is an opportunity given by God to 'bear witness' that the human will is unconquerable. Complaining about difficulty is disgracing one's calling. The true student of Stoicism desires difficult circumstances to prove their training, just as an athlete desires a strong opponent.",

He asks you, therefore: 'What did you call exile, imprisonment, chains, death, and disgrace back in the school?' 'I called them indifferent.' 'And now, what do you call them? Have those things changed?' 'No.' 'Have you changed?' 'No.' 'Tell me then, what things are indifferent?' 'Things not under the control of the will.' 'Tell me the consequence.' 'Things not under the control of the will are nothing to me.' 'Tell me also, what did you decide were good things?' 'A moral will as it ought to be, and the correct use of impressions.' 'And the goal?' 'To follow You.' 'Do you still say this now?' 'I say the very same things now.' By the gods, I imagine you will come to this realization: 'Why have we made such great and numerous preparations for nothing? Is this all that authority is? The vestibules, the chamberlains, the guards? Was it for this that I listened to so many discourses? These things were nothing, yet I prepared for them as if they were great matters.'",
    "notes": "This passage focuses on the transition from the theoretical study of Stoicism to its practical application under pressure. Epictetus dramatizes an internal dialogue between the student and God (or the Ideal Observer) during a confrontation with a tyrant. The core lesson is the stability of value judgments: what was true in the safety of the lecture hall—that external events like death or imprisonment are 'indifferent' and outside our moral control—remains true in the face of danger. The ultimate realization is that the trappings of worldly power are illusory and trivial ('nothing') when met with a prepared and virtuous will.",

    "english": "That confidence is not inconsistent with caution. It may perhaps seem a paradox to some—this claim made by philosophers—yet let us examine, as best we can, whether it is true that one must do everything with both caution and confidence. For caution seems in some way contrary to confidence, and contraries cannot coexist. But the apparent paradox here seems to me to stem from this: if we demanded that you use both caution and confidence toward the same objects, you would rightly accuse us of combining incompatible things. But now, what is strange in this statement? If those things inevitably said and demonstrated are true—that the essence of the Good is in the correct use of impressions, and the essence of Evil likewise, while things outside our will admit neither the nature of Good nor Evil—what is paradoxical about the philosophers' demand? They say: 'Where things are outside the will, there you must have confidence; where things are within the will, there you must have caution.' For if Evil lies in a bad moral choice, then toward this alone is it worth using caution; but if things outside the will are nothing to us, toward these we must use confidence. And thus we shall be at once cautious and confident—and indeed, confident precisely because of our caution. For by being cautious toward what is truly evil, we shall accidentally gain confidence toward what is not so. However, we behave like deer. When the deer fear the feathers and flee, where do they turn? To what safe haven do they retreat? To the nets! And so they perish because they confused what is fearful with what is safe. So it is with us: where do we employ our fear? Toward things outside our will. And in what matters do we behave with confidence, as if there were no danger? In matters of the will. To be deceived, to act rashly, to do something shameless, to lust with base desire—this matters nothing to us, provided we succeed in external affairs. Therefore, where we are most liable to error, we render our natural confidence into boldness, desperation, recklessness, and shamelessness; but where we should be naturally cautious and modest, we become cowardly and abject, full of fears and disturbances. For if one transfers caution to the realm of the will and the works of the will, immediately, along with the wish to be cautious, one will possess the power of aversion; but if one transfers it to things not in our power, attempting to avoid what depends on others, one will necessarily be afraid, unstable, and disturbed. For death or pain is not fearful, but the fear of pain or death is. Therefore, we praise the one who said: 'It is not death that is terrible, but dying shamefully.' We ought, then, to turn our confidence toward death, and our caution toward the fear of death; but now we do the opposite: we flee from death, yet concerning the judgment we hold about death, we are careless and indifferent. Socrates did well to call these things 'bugbears' (scarecrows). For just as masks seem terrible and fearsome to children because of their inexperience, we react somewhat the same way toward events, for no other reason than that we are like children toward bugbears. What is a child? Ignorance. What is a child? Lack of instruction. For where a child knows, he is no less than we are. What is death? A bugbear. Turn it around and look at it: see, it does not bite. The miserable little body must be separated from the miserable little spirit, as it was separated before, either now or later. Why are you indignant if it happens now? If not now, then later. Why? So that the cycle of the cosmos may be completed; for the cosmos has need of things present, things future, and things past. What is pain? A bugbear. Turn it around and look. The wretched flesh is moved roughly, then smoothly again. If it is not to your advantage, the door is open; if it is to your advantage, bear it. For the door must be open to all occasions, and thus we have no trouble. What, then, is the fruit of these doctrines? That which is most beautiful and most fitting for those who are truly being educated: tranquility, fearlessness, freedom. For we must not believe the many on these matters, who say that only free men should be educated, but rather we should believe the philosophers, who say that only the educated are free. — 'How is this?' — Thus: Is freedom anything other than the power to live as we wish? — 'Nothing else.' — Do you wish to live in fear? In grief? In turmoil? — 'By no means.' — Then no one who lives in fear, grief, or turmoil is free. ... Therefore, I say to you often: practice these things and have them ready at hand—toward what matters you must be confident, and toward what matters you must be cautious: confidence toward things outside the will, caution toward things within the will. — 'But I have not read to you my compositions, nor do you know what I am doing!' — In what? In little phrases? Keep your little phrases! Show me how you stand regarding desire and aversion: whether you do not fail in what you wish, and do not fall into what you do not wish. As for those little periods of yours, if you have any sense, you will take them somewhere else and wipe them out. — 'What then? Did Socrates not write?' — And who wrote as much as he? But how? Since he could not always have someone to test his judgments or be tested by him in turn, he tested and examined himself, and was always exercising some one preconception specifically for practical use. This is how a philosopher writes; but little phrases and 'style'—that is what you are showing me! You say, 'See how I compose dialogues.' Do not do this, man, but rather say: 'See how I do not fail in my desire. See how I do not fall into what I avoid. Bring on death and you shall know; bring on hardships, bring on prison, bring on disgrace, bring on condemnation.' This is the display of a young man who has come from the schools. Leave the rest to others; let no one hear a word from you about them, and even if someone praises you for them, do not tolerate it, but appear to be a nobody and to know nothing. Show only that you know this: how never to fail in desire nor fall into aversion. Let others practice lawsuits, others problems, others syllogisms; you practice how to die, how to be chained, how to be racked, how to be exiled. Do all these things with confidence, relying on Him who has called you to these sufferings, who has judged you worthy of this post, in which, once stationed, you will show what a rational ruling faculty can do when arrayed against forces outside the will. And thus, that paradox will no longer seem impossible or strange: that one must be at the same time cautious and confident—confident toward things outside the will, cautious in things within the will.",
    "notes": "This discourse presents the solution to a fundamental Stoic problem: how to avoid the paralyzing effects of anxiety while avoiding the recklessness of arrogance. Epictetus distinguishes the proper objects of 'Eulabeia' (Caution/Circumspection) and 'Tharsos' (Confidence/Courage). The mistake of the 'many' (the uneducated) is a reversal of values: they fear 'aproaireta' (externals like death, pain, and reputation) which are technically 'adiaphora' (indifferent), while remaining confident and careless about their 'prohairesis' (moral choice/will), which is the only place where true Good and Evil reside. Epictetus uses the metaphor of the deer to illustrate this: by fearing the 'feathers' (harmless scarecrows representing externals), we run into the 'nets' (real danger representing moral corruption). The true Stoic student must reverse this: exercise extreme vigilance (caution) over their own judgments and desires to avoid vice, but treat external events with absolute confidence, viewing them as mere 'bugbears' (mormolykeia)—scary masks that, when turned over, reveal natural processes. The 'freedom' mentioned is not legal status, but the psychological invulnerability of the one who cannot be coerced by fear or desire. The final rebuke targets students who focus on 'lexidia' (trivial rhetoric/little texts) rather than the hard work of training the will to accept mortality and hardship.",

    "english": "On Tranquillity. You there, on your way to court: look closely at what it is you wish to maintain and where you wish to succeed. For if you wish to maintain your moral purpose in harmony with nature, you are entirely safe; everything is easy for you; you have no trouble. If you wish to maintain what is in your own power and naturally free, and if you are content with these things, who is left for you to regard with anxiety? Who is the master of such things? Who can take them away from you? If you wish to be a man of honor and fidelity, who will not permit you? If you wish not to be hindered or compelled, who will force you to desire what you do not think good, or to avoid what you do not think bad? You say: 'But they will do things to me that seem fearful.' I answer: How can they make you suffer if you treat those things with indifference? When desire and aversion are in your own power, what is left for you to worry about? Let this be your introduction, this your narrative, this your proof, this your victory, this your conclusion, and this your applause. Therefore, when someone reminded Socrates to prepare for his trial, he replied: 'Do I not seem to you to have been preparing for this my whole life?' 'What kind of preparation?' the man asked. 'I have maintained that which is in my own power,' said Socrates. 'How so?' 'I have never done anything unjust, either in my private or public life.' But if you wish to maintain externals—your paltry body, your little property, your tiny reputation—then I tell you: start preparing immediately with every possible preparation, and study the nature of your judge and your adversary. If it is necessary to grab his knees, grab them; if to weep, weep; if to groan, groan. For once you have subordinated your own possessions to external things, you must be a slave from then on; do not pull in opposite directions. At one moment you wish to be a slave, and at another you do not; be simply one thing or the other, with your whole mind: either free or a slave, either educated or uneducated, either a thoroughbred rooster or a base one. Either endure being beaten until you die, or give up immediately. Do not take many blows only to give up in the end. But if these things are shameful, make the distinction immediately: Where is the nature of evil and good? It is where truth is. Where truth and nature are, there is caution; where truth is, there is confidence. Do you think that if Socrates wished to maintain his externals, he would have stood before the court and said, 'Anytus and Meletus can kill me, but they cannot hurt me'? Was he so foolish as not to see that this path does not lead to that result, but to another? Why, then, acts he thus? Because he is not concerned with the result. Compare this to my acquaintance Heraclitus, who had a small lawsuit in Rhodes. After proving to the judges that his cause was just, he came to his closing argument and said: 'I will not entreat you, nor do I care what you decide; for it is you who are on trial rather than I.' And so, he ruined the business. What need was there for that? Do not entreat, but do not add 'I do not entreat.' If you prepare such a conclusion, why go to court at all? Why answer the summons? If you wish to be crucified, wait, and the cross will come. But if reason chooses for you to answer the summons and do your best to persuade the judge, you must do what follows from that choice, while still maintaining your own character. In this light, it is ridiculous to say to me, 'Tell me what to do.' What advice should I give you? Rather say: 'Make my mind adaptable to whatever may happen.' For the former request is like an illiterate man saying, 'Tell me what to write when a name is proposed to me.' If I say 'Dion,' and then the man comes forward and proposes not the name 'Dion' but 'Theon,' what will happen? What will you write? If you have practiced writing, you can prepare for anything that is dictated to you; but if not, what can I suggest to you now? For if circumstances dictate something else, what will you say, or what will you do? Remember this general principle, and you will not lack for counsel: If you gape at external things, you must necessarily roll up and down according to the will of your master. And who is your master? He who has authority over any of the things you seek or shun.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus addresses the anxiety ('ataraxia' implies the absence of such anxiety) associated with facing external crises, using the metaphor of a lawsuit. The core lesson is the distinction between two modes of living: the free man and the slave. 1. The Definition of Slavery: Epictetus redefines slavery not as a legal status, but as a psychological dependency. If you value externals (body, property, reputation) over your own moral choice ('prohairesis'), you are a slave to anyone who controls those externals. The 'Master' is defined as anyone who has the power to give you what you want or take away what you fear. 2. Total Commitment: He warns against half-measures. If you choose to value externals, you must play that game fully—beg, grovel, and manipulate to save your skin. If you choose freedom (Stoicism), you must be willing to lose everything external, like Socrates. The worst state is to be a 'base rooster'—to endure the beating of the philosopher's path but eventually capitulate to the world. 3. The Art of Living vs. Specific Scripts: The concluding analogy of the illiterate man is pedagogically vital. Students often ask for specific advice ('What do I do in this specific situation?'). Epictetus rejects this casuistry. Just as a writer learns the alphabet to write *any* name, a Stoic learns the general principles of nature and the dichotomy of control to handle *any* circumstance. Preparation lies in character training, not in rehearsing scripts for specific events.",

    "english": "Regarding those who recommend people to philosophers: Diogenes gave an excellent answer to the man who asked him for a letter of recommendation. He said: 'That you are a human being, he will know as soon as he sees you. As to whether you are good or bad—if he has the expertise to distinguish the good from the bad, he will know that too. But if he lacks that expertise, he will not know it, not even if I write to him ten thousand times.' It is just as if a drachma coin were to ask for a recommendation so that it might be tested. 'If the judge is a silversmith, you will recommend yourself.' We need, therefore, to possess a standard in life similar to the one used for silver, so that I might be able to say, just as the silversmith says, 'Bring any drachma you want, and I will test it.' Now, in the case of syllogisms, I can say, 'Bring whoever you want, and I will distinguish for you the man who is analytical from the one who is not.' But in the conduct of life, what do I do? At one moment I call a thing good, at another bad. What is the cause? Ignorance and a lack of training—the very opposite of my state regarding syllogisms.",
    "notes": "Epictetus uses this interaction of Diogenes to illustrate that character, like silver or logic, requires a specific faculty of judgment to be properly assessed. A letter of recommendation is useless if the recipient lacks the wisdom to judge character, and unnecessary if they possess it, for the character speaks for itself. The deeper lesson is about our own inconsistency. While we may have mastered technical standards (like logic or metallurgy), we lack a consistent 'canon' or standard for the Art of Living. Consequently, we fluctuate in our judgments of what is good or bad, revealing our ignorance and lack of moral training.",

    "english": "I was speaking once about how human beings are created for fidelity, and that he who overturns this overturns the very essence of the human character, when there entered one of those so-called 'scholars'—a man who had once been caught in adultery in the city. \n\nI said to him: But if we cast aside this natural fidelity to plot against our neighbor's wife, what are we actually doing? What else but destroying and killing? Whom? The man of fidelity, the man of modesty, the man of piety within us. Is that all? Are we not also overthrowing neighborly relations, friendship, and the state itself? Into what position can we place you? How am I to use you, man? As a neighbor? As a friend? Of what kind? As a citizen? Who could possibly trust you? \n\nListen, if you were a piece of pottery so rotten that you were useless for any purpose, you would be thrown out on the dung heap, and no one would even pick you up from there. But if, being a man, you cannot fulfill any human role, what are we to do with you? Granted, you cannot hold the place of a friend; can you hold that of a slave? And who would trust you? Do you not wish to be cast out like a broken vessel, like dung? Then will you say, 'No one pays attention to me, a man of letters'? You possess a sting like a wasp; whatever you strike, you throw into trouble and pain. What do you want us to do with you? You have no place where you fit.\n\n'But,' you ask, 'are not women common property by nature?'\n\nI agree. Just as the small pig at a banquet is common to all the guests. But when the portions are distributed, go ahead—if you see fit—and snatch the portion of the man reclining next to you; steal it in secret, or slide your hand over and gluttonously taste it. If you cannot tear away the meat, grease your fingers and lick them. What a fine dinner companion! What a Socratic guest! \n\nCome now, is not the theater common to all citizens? Yet when they have taken their seats, come and throw someone out of his place if you think it right. So it is with women: they may be common by nature, but when the Lawgiver, like a host, has distributed them, do you not wish to seek your own portion? Instead, you steal and lick at what belongs to another. \n\n'But,' you say, 'I am a scholar and I understand the logic of Archedemus!'",
    "notes": "In this scathing lecture, Epictetus addresses the concept of 'pistis' (fidelity or trustworthiness), identifying it as a fundamental property of the human social animal. The central argument is that vice—specifically adultery in this context—is not merely a private pleasure but a destruction of the self. By acting treacherously, the adulterer annihilates the 'man of fidelity' within himself, rendering him socially useless. Epictetus uses the metaphor of a 'rotten vessel' (skeuarion) to illustrate that a human being who cannot be trusted in any role (friend, neighbor, citizen) is functionally obsolete, like a cracked pot thrown on a dunghill. He also dismantles the scholar's intellectual pretenses; the man tries to justify his lust by citing philosophical theories about wives being 'held in common' (likely a distortion of Zeno or Plato). Epictetus counters with practical social norms: just because a banquet is 'common' does not mean one can steal another's assigned portion. The lesson concludes with a sharp rebuke of the separation between intellectual knowledge ('I understand Archedemus') and moral character.",

    "english": "How can high-mindedness and carefulness coexist? Materials are indifferent, but the use of them is not indifferent. How, then, shall one preserve at once a steady and undisturbed mind, and yet be careful, neither reckless nor negligent? By imitating those who play at dice. The counters are indifferent; the dice are indifferent. How do I know what is going to fall? But to use the roll carefully and skillfully when it has fallen, that is now my task. So it is with life: the principal task is this: divide things and distinguish them. Say, 'Externals are not in my power; the will is in my power. Where shall I seek the good and the bad? Within, in the things that are my own.' But with regard to what is not your own, never apply the words good or bad, or benefit or harm. What then? Should we use these externals carelessly? By no means. For this is again bad for the faculty of will and contrary to nature. Rather, we must act carefully because the use is not indifferent, and yet with steadiness and tranquility because the material is indifferent. For where the material is not indifferent, there no one can hinder or compel me. Where I can be hindered and compelled, the obtaining of those things is not in my power, nor is it good or bad; but the use of them is either bad or good, and that is in my power. It is difficult to mingle and unite these two things: the carefulness of one who is attached to the matter, and the steadiness of one who regards it with indifference. Yet it is not impossible; otherwise, happiness is impossible. Act as we do in a sea voyage. What can I do? I can choose the captain, the sailors, the day, the opportunity. Then a storm falls upon us. What is that to me? I have fulfilled my part. The business belongs to another, to the pilot. But the ship is sinking! What then have I to do? I do the only thing I can; I do not drown full of fear, nor screaming, nor blaming God, but knowing that what has been born must also perish. For I am not an eon, but a human being, a part of the whole as an hour is of the day. I must come like the hour, and pass like the hour. What difference does it make to me how I pass away—whether by drowning or by a fever? For I must pass through some such means. You will see this done by those who play ball skillfully. No one among them contends about the ball itself as if it were a good or a bad thing, but about how to throw it and how to catch it. In this lies the grace, the art, the speed, the judgment: that I may not be able to catch it even if I spread out my cloak, while another catches it even if I throw it badly. But if we catch or throw with agitation and fear, what kind of play is that? How shall one maintain one's composure? Who will see what comes next in the game? One says 'Throw!' another 'Do not throw!' another 'You have thrown it once!' Thus, Socrates knew how to play ball. How? By playing in the courtroom. 'Tell me, Anytus,' he said, 'how do you say that I do not believe in God? The daemons, who do you think they are? Are they not children of gods, or mixed of men and gods?' And when Anytus agreed, Socrates said, 'Who then do you think can believe in mules, but not in donkeys?' He was playing with these arguments as with a ball, yet none the less he played the game with rhythm. So we also must practice care with the ball—the external matters—but treat the ball itself as indifferent. For one must by all means display skill concerning some external material, but not accept the material itself; rather, whatever it may be, one must display one's art regarding it. Just as the weaver does not produce the wool, but works upon whatever wool he receives. Another gives you food and property, and can take them away, along with your body itself. Do you, then, take the material and work it. Then, if you leave life without having suffered harm in your character, others who meet you will congratulate you on your escape; but the one who knows how to see these things, if he sees that you have behaved becomingly, will praise you and rejoice with you; but if he sees you saved through some shameful action, he will do the opposite. For where it is reasonable to rejoice, there it is also reasonable to offer congratulation. How, then, are some externals said to be according to nature and others contrary to nature? It is as if we were detached individuals. For to the foot, it is 'according to nature' to be clean; but if you take it as a foot, and not as a detached thing, it will be appropriate for it to step into the mud, and tread upon thorns, and sometimes to be cut off for the sake of the whole body; otherwise, it is no longer a foot. We must think something like this about ourselves. What are you? A human being. If you consider yourself as detached, it is according to nature to live to old age, to be rich, to be healthy. But if you consider yourself as a human being and a part of some whole, it is on account of that whole that it is fitting for you now to be sick, now to make a voyage and run risks, now to be in want, and perhaps to die before your time. Why then are you angry? Do you not know that as the foot is no longer a foot if detached, so you are no longer a human being? For what is a human being? A part of a city, first of that which consists of gods and men, and next of that which is called most close to us, which is a small copy of the universal city. 'Must I now be put on trial?' Whatever happens, it is your business to go and say what you must, and arrange these things as is fitting. Then the judge says, 'I judge you to be guilty.' 'I wish you well. I have done my part; if you have done yours, you will see.'",
    "notes": "This discourse presents the central paradox of Stoic action: How can we be deeply engaged in the world ('careful') while simultaneously remaining detached from outcomes ('high-minded')? Epictetus resolves this by distinguishing between the 'material' (hyle) and the 'use' (chresis). \n\n1. The Game Metaphor: Life is compared to a game of dice or ball. The ball (wealth, health, reputation) is indifferent—it has no intrinsic moral value. However, the skill with which we throw and catch the ball (our moral agency and character) is the only true good. We must play the game with total commitment and artistry, but without anxiety over who 'wins' the ball.\n\n2. The Two Realms: We control our volition (prohairesis), but we do not control externals. Anxiety arises when we confuse the two. If we care about the external result, we become slaves to fortune. If we care only about our own integrity in the moment of action, we remain free.\n\n3. The Part and the Whole (Cosmopolitanism): Epictetus uses the analogy of the foot. An isolated foot wants to stay clean. A foot that understands it is part of a body knows it must sometimes step in mud to serve the whole. Similarly, a Stoic accepts sickness, poverty, or early death not as misfortunes, but as necessary duties assigned by the universe (the cosmic city of gods and men) to maintain the whole. To complain is to cease being a human—a rational part of the cosmos—and become a detached, useless fragment.",

    "english": "On Indifference.\n\nThe hypothetical argument itself is a matter of indifference; but the judgment regarding it is not indifferent—it is either knowledge, opinion, or deception. In the same way, life is indifferent, but the use of life is not. Therefore, when someone tells you that these external things are indifferent, do not become careless; nor, when someone urges you to be careful, should you become abased or awestruck by the material world.\n\nIt is good to know your own preparation and capacity, so that in matters where you are untrained, you may keep quiet and not be vexed if others surpass you. If someone beats you in a logical argument, you do not get angry, but rather say to yourself, 'I learned this, and you did not.' Similarly, where some specific skill is required, do not seek the reputation that comes from that skill if you lack it; yield that to those who have practiced it, and let it be enough for you to maintain your own mental stability.\n\n'Go and pay your respects to So-and-so.'\n'I pay them.'\n'How?'\n'Not in a slavish manner.'\n'But you were shut out.'\n'I have not learned to climb in through the window. If I find the door shut, I must either go away or enter through the window. But I choose to go away.'\n'But speak to him!'\n'I speak.'\n'In what way?'\n'Not as a groveler.'\n'But you did not get what you wanted.'\n\nThis is why Chrysippus speaks well: 'As long as the future is uncertain to me, I always hold to those things which are better adapted for obtaining the things in accordance with nature; for God himself has made me prone to select these. But if I actually knew that it was fated for me to be sick now, I would even have an impulse toward sickness. For the foot also, if it had a mind, would have an impulse to step in the mud.'\n\nFor why do ears of corn grow? Is it not that they may ripen? And do they not ripen so that they may be reaped? They are not things apart. If, then, they had perception, ought they to pray that they should never be reaped? No, for the curse of the ear of corn is exactly that: never to be reaped. Know, then, that for men it is likewise a curse not to die; it is like not ripening, not being harvested. But because we are the ones who must be reaped, and yet we are also aware that we are being reaped, we are angry about it. For we do not know who we are, nor have we practiced human matters as horse-trainers practice matters of horsemanship.\n\nBut consider Chrysantas: just as he was about to strike the enemy, he heard the trumpet sound the retreat and checked his hand. Thus, the command of the general seemed of greater value to him than his own action. But not one of us, even when Necessity calls, is willing to obey readily; instead, weeping and groaning, we suffer what we suffer, calling them 'circumstances.' What circumstances, man? If by circumstances you mean the things that surround you, everything is a circumstance. But if you use the word to mean difficulties, what difficulty is there in that which was born simply dying? The instrument of destruction may be a sword, a wheel, the sea, a tile, or a tyrant. What does it matter to you by which road you descend to Hades? They are all equal. But if you want the truth, the one the tyrant sends you on is shorter.\n\nAll these things are merely noise and a clatter of empty names. 'I risk my head before Caesar.' But you also risk your judgment. 'But I risk exile.' Yes. So what if you are sent to Gyara? Why do you treat these things as if they were great? They are smaller than your preparation for them—unless a young man of good natural parts is to say that it was not worth the effort to have heard so many lectures, written so many exercises, and sat so long by an old man of no great worth.\n\nOnly remember that distinction by which what is yours is separated from what is not yours. Do not lay claim to what belongs to others. The tribunal and the prison are each a place; one is high, the other low; but your moral purpose is the same, and if you choose to keep it equal in both places, it can be kept. We shall strictly be emulators of Socrates only when we are able to write hymns in prison. But as we are now, consider whether we could endure it if someone else came to us in prison and said, 'Shall I read you some hymns?' We would say, 'Why do you trouble me? Do you not see the evils that hold me? For in this situation, I am about to die.'",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus clarifies the concept of 'indifference' (adiaphora). A common misunderstanding of Stoicism is that indifference implies apathy or carelessness. Epictetus corrects this: while external outcomes (health, wealth, reputation) are indifferent, our *use* of them is not. We must be diligent in our judgments and choices (our internal sphere) while remaining detached from the results (the external sphere).\n\nThe lecture employs powerful analogies to illustrate alignment with Nature. The 'Foot' analogy suggests that a part must serve the whole; if a foot had consciousness, it would willingly step in mud to serve the body's movement. Similarly, the 'Ear of Corn' analogy reframes death not as a tragedy, but as a harvest—a natural fulfillment of the cycle of life. To wish never to die is a 'curse,' just as it would be a curse for wheat never to ripen.\n\nEpictetus also addresses the proper attitude toward power and 'circumstances' (peristaseis). We should not fear tyrants or executioners, as they only control the method of our departure, not the departure itself, which is inevitable. The true Stoic test is maintaining the same 'prohairesis' (moral character/will) in a high place (the tribunal) as in a low place (prison). The ultimate goal is the composure of Socrates, who could compose poetry while awaiting execution, contrasted with the average person who is too consumed by anxiety to function.",

    "english": "How are we to make use of divination? Through its untimely use, many of us neglect our duties. For what can the diviner see beyond death, danger, sickness, or generally things of that nature? If, then, it is necessary to face danger for a friend, or if it is even your duty to die for him, what room is left for divination? Do I not possess the diviner within myself—the reason which has told me the essence of good and evil, and explained the signs of both? What further need have I of entrails or birds? Can I endure the diviner when he asks, 'Does this profit you?' Does he know what is good? Has he learned the signs of good and evil as he has learned the signs of the viscera? Man, you tell me what the omen signifies: life or death, poverty or wealth. But whether these things are profitable or unprofitable, am I to ask you? Why do you not give opinions on grammar? And yet here, where all men go astray and fight one another, you claim authority? Therefore, that woman spoke well who wished to send a ship of provisions to the exiled Gratilla, saying, 'I would rather that Domitian take these things away, than that I should fail to send them.' What is it, then, that leads us to consult divination so constantly? It is cowardice; the fear of consequences. This is why we flatter the soothsayers: 'Master, shall I inherit from my father?' 'Let us see; let us sacrifice.' 'Yes, Master, as Fortune wills.' We ought to approach God without desire or aversion, just as a traveler asks directions from a man he meets on the road; he does not demand that the road lead to the right or left, but wishes only to know the true path. But now, trembling, we hold the sacrificial bird and invoke God, begging him: 'Lord, have mercy; allow me to come out safe.' Why, as far as it lies in your power, do you corrupt your judge and mislead your counselor?",
    "notes": "Epictetus addresses the improper reliance on external signs (divination) to determine one's actions. The core Stoic lesson here is that moral duty (the Good) is determined by Reason and the Will (Prohairesis), not by external circumstances like safety, wealth, or health. A diviner can predict 'death' or 'poverty' (which are 'indifferents' in Stoicism), but they cannot tell you whether you should act courageously or virtuously in the face of them—only your internal moral compass can do that. Consulting a soothsayer to avoid danger when duty calls is an act of cowardice. One should approach the future not with a desire for specific outcomes, but with the readiness to accept whatever Reality (God) presents, using one's own faculties to navigate it virtuously.",

    "english": "What is the substance of the Good? God is beneficial; but the Good is also beneficial. It is logical, therefore, that wherever the substance of God is found, there too is the substance of the Good. What then is the substance of God? Flesh? God forbid. Land? God forbid. Fame? God forbid. It is Mind, Knowledge, and Right Reason. So, seek the substance of the Good strictly in these things.\n\nDo you seek it in a plant? No. In an irrational animal? No. If you seek it in a rational being, why look anywhere else than in that which distinguishes him from the irrational? Plants do not even handle impressions; therefore, you do not speak of the 'Good' in relation to them. The Good, then, requires the use of impressions. Is that alone enough? If it were, you would have to say that the Good, along with happiness and unhappiness, exists in other animals too. But you do not say this, and you are right not to. For even if they fully possess the use of impressions, they lack the understanding and monitoring of that use.\n\nAnd this is reasonable. They were created to serve others, not to be primary beings. The donkey was not created for its own sake, was it? No, it was created because we needed a back able to carry burdens. And by Zeus, we also needed it to walk; for this reason, it received the power to use impressions, for otherwise, it could not walk. But that is where its faculties stop. If the donkey had acquired the understanding of its use of impressions, it is clear that, according to reason, it would no longer be subject to us or provide these services, but would be our equal and peer.\n\nWill you not, then, seek the substance of the Good in that faculty whose absence prevents you from attributing the Good to other things?\n\n'But what then? Are not those other creatures also works of God?'\n\nYes, but you are a primary being; you are a fragment of God! You possess a distinct part of Him within yourself. Why then are you ignorant of your high kinship? Why do you not know where you have come from? When you eat, will you not remember who you are that eats, and whom you are feeding? When you have intercourse, or when you socialize, when you exercise, when you engage in dialogue—do you not know that you are nourishing a God, exercising a God? You carry God around with you, you wretch, and you are ignorant of it!\n\nDo you suppose I mean some god of silver or gold carried in a pocket? You carry Him within your own self, and you do not notice that you are polluting Him with impure thoughts and filthy actions. If a mere statue of God were present, you would not dare to do any of the things you are doing. But when God Himself is present within, seeing all and hearing all, are you not ashamed to think and do these things, O you who are insensible of your own nature and an object of divine wrath?\n\nWhy, then, do we fear when we send a young man from the school into action, lest he act improperly, eat improperly, have illicit sex, be humiliated by wearing rags, or be puffed up by fine clothes? This man simply does not know his own God; he does not know with whom he walks. Yet we endure him saying, 'I wish I had you with me!' Do you not have God there with you? And do you seek any other when you possess Him? Will God tell you anything different than what your reason tells you?\n\nIf you were a statue by Phidias—his Athena or his Zeus—you would remember both yourself and the artist; if you had any sense, you would try not to do anything unworthy of your maker or yourself, nor to appear in an unbecoming posture before beholders. But now, because Zeus has made you, do you therefore care not strictly how you present yourself? Yet what is the comparison between the artists or the works? What work of an artist contains within itself the faculties that the artist displayed in making it? Is it not merely stone, bronze, gold, or ivory? The Athena of Phidias, once it extended its hand and received the Nike, stands that way for all eternity; but the works of God are capable of movement, breath, the use of impressions, and judgment.\n\nBeing, then, the work of such a Craftsman, will you disgrace Him? And consider this: He not only created you, but He entrusted you to yourself alone, and gave you into your own keeping. Will you not remember this either, but disgrace your guardianship? If God had entrusted an orphan to your care, would you neglect him so? He has handed you over to yourself, saying: 'I had no one more trustworthy than you; keep this man for me just as he was born—modest, faithful, high-minded, unterrified, passionless, untroubled.'\n\nBut people will say: 'Where did this man get that haughty brow and grave face?' I have not yet gained full confidence in what I have learned and assented to; I still fear my own weakness. Let me gain that confidence, and then you will see the proper look and the proper bearing. Then I will show you the statue when it is finished and polished. What do you expect? A haughty brow? Heaven forbid. The Zeus at Olympia does not have a haughty brow; his gaze is steady, as becomes one who is about to say: 'I will show myself to you—faithful, modest, noble, untroubled.'\n\n'Does that mean immortal, ageless, and free from sickness?'\n\nNo, but dying like a god, and being sick like a god. This I possess, this I can do; the rest I neither have nor can do. I will show you the sinews of a philosopher.\n\n'What sinews are those?'\n\nDesire that never misses its mark, aversion that never falls into what it avoids, impulse that fits the duty, intention that is careful, and assent that is not precipitate. These are what you shall see.",
    "notes": "1. **Rationality as the Divine Substance:** Epictetus argues that the 'Good' is located strictly in the reasoning faculty (prohairesis). Animals use impressions (phantasiai) for survival, but humans possess the unique capacity to *understand* and *monitor* these impressions. This reflective capability is the dividing line between man and beast.\n\n2. **The Fragment of God:** This is one of the most powerful theological claims in Stoicism. We are not merely creations of God; we are 'fragments' (apospasma) of the Divine Mind. This implies that our reason is consubstantial with God's reason. Consequently, self-respect is a form of religious piety. To act viciously is to drag God through the mud.\n\n3. **Stewardship of the Self:** Epictetus uses the metaphor of a trust (parakatathēkē). God has entrusted our character to us because we are the only ones capable of guarding it. We have a fiduciary duty to return our character to God in the same condition it was designed for: virtuous, modest, and free from perturbation.\n\n4. **The 'Nerves' of the Philosopher:** A crucial redefinition of strength. In a gym, sinews represent physical power. In the Stoic school, the 'sinews' are the disciplined operations of the mind: 1) **Desire:** Aimed only at virtue (what is in our control). 2) **Aversion:** Directed only at vice (what is in our control). 3) **Assent:** Withheld from uncertain or false impressions. This is the practical proof of philosophy, not the appearance of gravity or arrogance.",

    "english": "Because we are unable to fulfill the profession of a Man, we take on the additional burden of the profession of a Philosopher. Yet, it is no trivial task merely to fulfill the profession of a Man. For what is a Man? A rational, mortal animal, you say. Right then—from what are we distinguished by the rational faculty? From wild beasts. And from what else? From sheep and the like. Watch out, then, lest you act like a wild beast; if you do, you have destroyed the Man; you have not fulfilled your profession. Watch out lest you act like a sheep; if you do, the Man is destroyed in that way too. \n\nWhen do we act as sheep? When we act for the sake of the belly, or for the genitals, or at random, or filthily, or without consideration. Where have we deviated? To the sheep. What have we destroyed? The rational faculty. When we act contentiously, harmfully, angrily, and violently, where have we deviated? To the wild beasts. Consequently, some of us are great wild beasts, while others are little beasts, malicious and petty, prompting the saying: 'Let a lion devour me!' But by all these behaviors, the profession of a Man is destroyed. \n\nFor when is a complex proposition preserved? When it fulfills its promise. When is a disjunctive proposition preserved? When it fulfills its promise. When are flutes, a lyre, a horse, or a dog preserved? What is strange, then, if a Man is also preserved in the same way, and destroyed in the same way? Each thing is increased and preserved by its corresponding actions: the carpenter by acts of carpentry, the grammarian by acts of grammar. But if he gets used to writing ungrammatically, his art must necessarily be corrupted and destroyed. So, too, the modest man is preserved by modest acts but destroyed by shameless ones; the man of fidelity is preserved by faithful acts and destroyed by the contrary. And contrary acts strengthen contrary characters: shamelessness strengthens the shameless man, faithlessness the faithless, abusiveness the abusive, anger the angry, and disproportionate taking and giving the miser. \n\nThis is why philosophers warn us not to be satisfied with mere learning, but to add practice, and then training. For we have long been accustomed to doing the opposite, and we employ opinions that are the opposite of the correct ones. If, therefore, we do not make the correct opinions active and ready for use, we shall be nothing more than expositors of other people's doctrines. \n\nRight now, who among us cannot give a technical discourse on good and evil? 'Of things that exist, some are good, some are evil, and some are indifferent; good are the virtues and things that participate in them; evil are the opposites; indifferent are wealth, health, and reputation.' But let a sudden loud noise occur while we are speaking, or let someone in the audience laugh at us, and we are thunderstruck. Where, philosopher, are those things you were just talking about? From where were you uttering them? From the lips alone. Why, then, do you pollute help that belongs to others? Why do you gamble with matters of the highest importance? \n\nIt is one thing to store bread and wine in a pantry, and another to eat them. What is eaten is digested, distributed, and becomes sinews, flesh, bones, blood, a healthy complexion, and good breath. Whatever is merely stored, you can take out and show whenever you please, but you derive no benefit from it other than the reputation of possessing it. For what is the difference between expounding on these doctrines and expounding on those of another school? Sit down now and give a technical explanation of the doctrines of Epicurus, and perhaps you will explain them more effectively than he could. \n\nWhy, then, do you call yourself a Stoic? Why do you deceive the multitude? Why do you act the part of a Jew when you are a Greek? Do you not see how each person is called a Jew, a Syrian, or an Egyptian? And when we see someone wavering, we are in the habit of saying, 'He is not a Jew, he is only acting the part.' So we, too, are 'false-baptists,' Jews in name only, but something else in deed, having no sympathy with our own reason, and being far from applying the principles we speak of—principles upon which we pride ourselves as if we actually knew them. Thus, unable even to fulfill the profession of a Man, we take on the additional burden of the Philosopher—a load as heavy as if a man, unable to lift ten pounds, should try to heave the stone of Ajax.",
    "notes": "This section serves as a severe admonition against 'academic' Stoicism—the accumulation of knowledge without the transformation of character. Epictetus introduces the concept of the 'profession' (epangelia) of a human being. Being human is not a biological given but a moral achievement; to maintain our humanity, we must cultivate our distinguishing faculty: Reason (Logos). When we succumb to unthinking lust or laziness, we devolve into 'sheep'; when we succumb to aggression and anger, we devolve into 'wild beasts.' \n\nThe core pedagogical metaphor here is 'digestion.' Just as stored food is useless until it is eaten, digested, and turned into muscle (sinews), philosophical doctrines are useless if they remain merely 'on the lips.' True philosophy is not the ability to recite definitions of 'good' and 'evil' (which even a non-Stoic could memorize), but the physiological and psychological transformation that occurs when those doctrines are metabolized into action. \n\nEpictetus concludes with a sharp rebuke of hypocrisy, using the analogy of religious conversion (Greek vs. Jew). A 'parabaptist' (one who is falsely or incompletely dipped) represents the student who wears the cloak of the philosopher but lacks the internal commitment. The lesson is practical and humbling: before you try to carry the heavy weight of being a sage (the stone of Ajax), first prove you can carry the basic weight of being a rational human being (ten pounds).",

    "english": "Consider who you are. First, you are a human being; this means you possess nothing more sovereign than your own Will. To this Will, all other things are subordinate, but the Will itself is enslaved to nothing and subject to no one. Consider, then, from what you are separated by virtue of your reason. You are separated from wild beasts; you are separated from sheep. Furthermore, you are a citizen of the universe and a part of it—not a subordinate part, but a principal one, for you are capable of understanding the divine administration and reasoning upon the consequences of things. What, then, is the profession of such a citizen? To hold nothing as purely private interest, to deliberate about nothing as if you were detached from the whole, but rather to act as a hand or foot would if they had reason and understood the constitution of nature—they would never exercise impulse or desire except by reference to the whole. Therefore, the philosophers rightly say that if a wise and good man could foresee the future, he would cooperate even with sickness, death, and mutilation, realizing that these are allotted from the arrangement of the whole, and that the whole is more sovereign than the part, and the city more than the citizen. But since we do not foresee the future, it is our duty to hold to those things which are naturally more fit for our selection, for we were born for this purpose.\n\nNext, remember that you are a son. What is the profession of this role? To treat everything that is your own as belonging to your father, to obey him in all things, never to speak ill of him to anyone, nor to say or do anything that might harm him, to give way to him and yield in all things, cooperating with him to the utmost of your power. Next, know that you are also a brother. To this role belongs deference, obedience, and speaking well of one another. Do not contend with him about external things; gladly sacrifice a little seat or a little gain so that you may acquire the greater asset of his gratitude and affection. Look at what it is you are exchanging: for a lettuce, perhaps, or a chair, you acquire a brother's love! \n\nAfter this, if you are a councilor of a city, remember that you are a councilor; if young, that you are young; if old, that you are an elder; if a father, that you are a father. For each of these titles, when carefully weighed, suggests the acts appropriate to it. But if you go and revile your brother, I tell you that you have forgotten who you are and what your name is. If you were a smith and used your hammer wrongly, you would have forgotten the smith; but if you forget the brother and become an enemy instead, do you think you have made no exchange? If instead of a human—a gentle and social animal—you become a wild beast, mischievous and biting, have you lost nothing? Must you lose a coin to suffer damage, and does the loss of nothing else damage a human being?\n\nIf you were to lose your skill in grammar or music, you would consider it a loss; but if you lose your sense of shame, your dignity, and your gentleness, do you think this is of no consequence? Yet those former things are lost through external causes often beyond our will, but these moral qualities are lost through our own fault. To possess those skills is not necessarily noble, nor is losing them shameful; but to lose these virtues—and to not possess them—is a disgrace, a reproach, and a calamity. What does the adulterer lose? He loses the man of self-respect, the man of self-control, the gentle man, the neighbor, the citizen. What does the angry man lose? Something else. The coward? Something else. No one is bad without suffering loss and damage. \n\nIf you look for your damage only in money, then all these people I mentioned are unharmed; indeed, they may even be profited and gain money by their wicked acts. But look closely: if you make money your standard for everything, then the man who cuts off your nose has not harmed you. 'Yes,' you say, 'for my body is mutilated.' Well then, if a man loses his sense of smell entirely, has he lost nothing? Is there, then, no faculty of the soul which benefits him who possesses it and harms him who loses it? 'What faculty do you mean?' Have we no natural sense of shame? 'We have.' Does he who loses this suffer no damage? Is he deprived of nothing? Do we not have a natural fidelity, a natural affection, a natural benevolence? And is he who allows himself to be damaged in these matters unharmed?\n\n'What then?' you ask, 'Shall I not harm the one who harmed me?' First, look at what 'harm' means. Remember what you have heard from the philosophers. If the good lies in the Will, and the evil likewise in the Will, see if what you are saying does not amount to this: 'Since that man has harmed himself by doing me an injustice, shall I not harm myself by doing him an injustice?' Why do we not view the matter this way? Instead, where there is loss of body or property, we count it as harm; but where there is loss of our own Will and character, we count it as no harm. For the man who is deceived or acts unjustly has no pain in his head or his eye or his hip; he loses no land. But these are the only things we care about. As for our Will and our character—whether it be kept modest and faithful or becomes shameless and treacherous—we care not a straw, except solely for the logic of chopping arguments!",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus introduces the concept of Role Ethics (Persona Theory). The core Stoic doctrine here is that our duties (kathēkonta) are discovered by analyzing the names or titles we hold. We act correctly by fulfilling the definition of these roles. \n\n1. **The Hierarchy of Roles:** We start as human beings (rational agents with Prohairesis), then citizens of the cosmos (Cosmopolitanism), then familial roles (son, brother), and finally social roles (councilor, father). Neglecting the duties of a specific role implies a disintegration of the self.\n2. **The Nature of Loss:** Epictetus challenges the student's definition of 'harm.' The untrained mind thinks harm is financial loss or physical injury. The Stoic view is that true harm is the corruption of the character (Prohairesis). If you become angry or treacherous, you have dehumanized yourself, turning into a 'beast' or a 'wolf.' This internal moral injury is the only thing we should fear.\n3. **Rejection of Retaliation:** The desire for revenge is irrational. If someone harms you, they have actually harmed their own character by acting unjustly. If you retaliate, you merely duplicate the error, harming your own character in the process. You cannot 'balance' the equation of justice by adding your own moral vice to theirs.",

    "english": "What is the beginning of philosophy? For those who grasp it as they ought—entering, as it were, by the main door—it is a consciousness of their own weakness and incapacity regarding necessary things. For we come into the world having no natural concept of a right-angled triangle or a musical interval; we learn each of these through technical instruction, and those who do not know them do not suppose that they do. But regarding Good and Evil, Noble and Base, Proper and Improper, Happiness, Duty, and Obligation—who has ever entered the world without an innate concept of these things? This is why we all use these terms and try to fit our natural preconceptions to particular cases: 'He did well,' 'He did not do as he ought,' 'He was unlucky,' 'He was fortunate,' 'He is unjust,' 'He is just.' Who among us spares these words? Who waits to use them until he has learned their true meaning, as one waits to study lines or sounds? No one! The cause of this is that we come already 'taught' by nature, or so we think, and based on this, we add our own arrogant opinion.\n\nHere is where the investigation begins, and here is where arrogance creeps in. You start with these generally agreed-upon concepts, but in applying them to specific matters of dispute, you fall into improper application. If you actually possessed the ability to apply them, what would stop you from being perfect? But now, since you think you apply your preconceptions correctly to particular cases, tell me: where do you derive this confidence? 'Because it seems so to me.' Does it not seem so to the madman as well? Does he do anything other than what seems right to him? Is this criterion sufficient for him? 'No.' Then go look for something superior to mere opinion!\n\nWhat, then, is the beginning of philosophy? It is the observation of the conflict between men; it is the search for the cause of this conflict; it is the condemnation and mistrust of mere opinion; it is the investigation of that which 'seems' to see if it rightly seems; it is the discovery of a standard, just as we found the balance for weights and the carpenter's rule for straight and crooked lines. Is this the beginning of philosophy? Is everything that seems right to everyone true? How can contradictory things both be right? Therefore, not all things are true, but only those that seem so to us? Why 'us' rather than the Syrians? Why rather than the Egyptians? Why my opinion rather than that of any random person? There is no reason.\n\nTherefore, the opinion of each man is not sufficient to determine reality. Even in weights and measures, we are not satisfied with mere appearance; we have invented a standard for each. Is there, then, no standard here for the most necessary things among men? Is the truth impossible to judge or find? It exists! Why then do we not seek it, find it, and having found it, use it unswervingly, not stretching out even a finger without it? For this, I think, is what—when found—cures the madness of those who measure everything by 'seeming.' It allows us to start from known and clearly defined principles and apply our natural concepts to particular cases with articulation.\n\nWhat is the subject we are investigating? Pleasure. Bring it to the standard; throw it on the scale. Must the Good be something in which we can place confidence and trust? 'Yes.' Is it fitting to trust the unstable? 'No.' Is pleasure stable? 'No.' Then take it and throw it out of the scale! Drive it far from the land of the Good. But if your sight is dim and one scale is not enough, bring another. Is it fitting to be elated by the Good? 'Yes.' Is it fitting to be elated by the presence of pleasure? Watch that you do not say it is fitting; if you do, I shall no longer consider you worthy even of the scale! This is how things are judged and weighed when the standards are ready. To philosophize is this: to examine and establish these standards. To use them, once known, is the work of a good and noble man.",
    "notes": "Epictetus here defines the epistemological foundation of Stoic training. The central problem is not that humans lack moral instincts—we possess innate 'prolepseis' (preconceptions) of Good and Evil. The error lies in the application of these general concepts to specific 'ousiai' (substances or events). For example, everyone agrees 'The Good' is desirable, but the uneducated man falsely applies the label 'Good' to 'Pleasure' or 'Wealth.'\n\nThe 'Beginning of Philosophy' is the humble admission that one's subjective opinion ('doxa') is an insufficient criterion for truth, just as a madman's opinion is insufficient for reality. Epictetus uses the metaphor of the 'kanon' (ruler/standard) and the 'zygos' (balance scale). Philosophy is the act of discovering this objective standard—Reason and Nature—rather than relying on cultural or personal bias (Syrian vs. Egyptian opinions).\n\nThe final section demonstrates the Socratic dialectic used to test a hypothesis. By agreeing on the attributes of 'The Good' (trustworthiness, stability), Epictetus logically excludes 'Pleasure' from the category of 'The Good,' demonstrating how the standard must be applied to specific cases.",

    "english": "Regarding the art of conversation: Our school has successfully defined what is required to understand and utilize logic. But regarding the actual practice of it? We are completely untrained. Give any one of us a layman to converse with, and we are at a loss. We stir the man up a little, but as soon as he deviates from our prepared scripts, we cannot handle him. We resort to verbal abuse or mockery, declaring, 'He is an idiot; there is no dealing with him!' Consider a guide who finds a traveler going the wrong way. He does not mock the man or verbally abuse him and walk away; he leads him back to the correct path. You must do the same. Show the man the truth, and you will see that he follows. But so long as you do not show him, do not mock him; rather, recognize your own incapacity. How did Socrates act? He compelled the very man debating him to be his witness; he needed no other. He could say, 'I let others go, but I am satisfied with the witness of my opponent.' He made the concepts so evident that anyone could perceive the contradiction and withdraw from it. He would ask: 'Does the envious man rejoice?' 'Not at all, he is pained.' 'At evils?' 'No, that would be pity.' 'So envy is pain at good things?' Thus, he made the man define it himself. But we? We use technical jargon that is burdensome and unintelligible to the layman. Because we cannot move the layman through his own impressions, we give up and resort to insults. The primary characteristic of Socrates was this: he never became irritated in an argument, never uttered an insult, but endured abuse and ended conflicts. If you want to know his power, read Xenophon's Symposium. But now? This practice is not safe, especially here in Rome. You cannot simply walk up to a rich Consul and ask: 'You entrust your horses to a stable-master, your gold to a banker, your body to a physician... but to whom have you entrusted your soul? Your greatest possession? Is it neglected?' He will snap at you: 'What is that to you? Are you my master?' Even I was once zealous for this kind of discourse, before I fell into my current circumstances.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus addresses the gap between theoretical logic and practical social interaction. The central Stoic lesson is that the rational mind is compelled to assent to truth when it is clearly presented. Therefore, if a philosopher fails to convince a layman, the fault lies with the teacher's inability to demonstrate the truth clearly, not with the student's stupidity. Epictetus uses Socrates as the exemplar of the 'dialectic' method: leading an opponent to truth through their own admissions without ego or anger. The text serves as a warning against intellectual arrogance; using technical terminology ('jargon') masks one's own inability to guide others. Finally, Epictetus offers a pragmatic warning about the dangers of 'Socratic questioning' in a tyrannical political climate (Rome), noting that challenging the moral authority of powerful men requires not just truth, but prudence and safety.",

    "english": "When I see a man in a state of anxiety, I say to myself: 'What can this man possibly want?' If he did not want something that is not within his own power, how could he still be anxious? Consider the lyre-player: when he sings alone, he shows no anxiety; but when he enters the theater, even if he has a magnificent voice and plays the lyre beautifully, he panics. Why? Because he not only wishes to sing well—which is in his power—but also to win applause, which is not. Where he possesses knowledge, there he possesses confidence. Bring in any untrained person you like, and the musician pays them no mind. But where he is ignorant and unpracticed, there he is anxious. What does this mean? He does not know what a crowd is, or what the praise of a crowd is. He has learned how to strike the lowest and highest notes, but he neither knows nor has studied what the praise of the many actually is, or what power it holds in life. Consequently, he must tremble and grow pale. So, when I see someone terrified, I cannot call him a musician; I can say something else about him—many things, in fact. First of all, I call him a stranger. This man does not know where in the world he is; though he has lived here so long, he remains ignorant of the laws and customs of the City, of what is permitted and what is not. He has never consulted a lawyer to explain the statutes to him. He does not write a will without knowing how, yet he exercises desire, aversion, impulse, and design without legal counsel. How so? He desires things that are not given to him, and he fails to understand what is his own and what belongs to others. If he knew this, he would never be hindered, never obstructed, and never anxious. Is anyone afraid of things that are not evils? No. Is anyone afraid of evils that are within their own power to prevent? Certainly not. If, then, things outside our moral choice are neither good nor evil, and all things within our moral choice are up to us—where no one can take them away or force upon us what we do not want—where is there left any room for anxiety? But we are anxious about this paltry body, about our little possessions, about what Caesar will think—yet not about anything internal. Are we anxious about harboring a false opinion? No, for that is up to me. About acting against nature? No, nor about that. Therefore, when you see someone turning pale, just as a doctor diagnoses from the complexion saying, 'This man's spleen is sick,' or 'That man's liver is wrong,' you should say: 'This man’s desire and aversion are sick; they are not moving well; they are inflamed.' This is why Zeno was not anxious when he was about to meet Antigonus. For Antigonus had no power over the things Zeno admired, and Zeno cared nothing for the things Antigonus controlled. But Antigonus was anxious when about to meet Zeno, and rightly so, for he wanted to please him, and that was outside his power. You ask: 'But I am anxious about how I shall speak to him.' Why? Is it not in your power to speak as you wish? 'But I fear I may be interrupted.' If you were about to write the name of Dion, would you be afraid of being interrupted? 'No.' Why? Because you have practiced writing. Is it not the same when reading? Why then do you fear now? Because every art contains strength and confidence within its own domain. Have you not practiced speaking? What else did you practice in the school? Syllogisms and changing arguments? To what end? Was it not to discourse with skill? And does 'with skill' not mean explicitly, securely, intelligently, and—more than that—without failure, without hindrance, and with confidence? 'Yes, but he has the power to kill me.' Then speak the truth, you wretched man! Do not be arrogant, do not claim to be a philosopher, and do not ignore your true masters. As long as you offer this handle—your body—for others to grip, you must follow every man who is stronger than you. Socrates practiced speaking—he who spoke to tyrants, to judges, and in prison. Diogenes practiced speaking—he who spoke to Alexander, to Philip, to pirates, and to the man who bought him as a slave.",
    "notes": "This section of the Discourses (2.13, 'On Anxiety') provides the definitive Stoic diagnosis of nervousness (agonia). Epictetus argues that social anxiety is a cognitive error, not an emotional condition. 1. The root of anxiety: Anxiety is proof that you desire something outside your control (externals). If you only desired the proper use of your own will (prohairesis), you would be invincible, as no one can force you to assent to a false impression. 2. The Musician's Paradox: Epictetus contrasts technical skill with philosophical ignorance. A musician knows his instrument (internal competence) but fears the audience (external variable). He is anxious because he values the applause—which he cannot control—more than the performance itself—which he can. 3. The 'Stranger' Metaphor: We are citizens of the Cosmos, yet we act like ignorant tourists. We haven't studied the 'laws' of this city, which state that the body and reputation are not truly ours. We try to claim ownership of things that don't belong to us, causing inevitable suffering. 4. The Doctor of the Soul: Just as pallor indicates physical illness, anxiety indicates a sickness of the will. The anxious person is not 'unlucky'; they are engaging in a vice by valuing safety or praise over their own integrity. 5. True Confidence: Confidence comes from indifference to outcomes. Zeno (the founder of Stoicism) was calm before the tyrant Antigonus because Zeno wanted nothing Antigonus could give, and feared nothing Antigonus could inflict. If you fear a powerful man, you are admitting that you value your body more than your character.",

    "english": "When a certain Roman entered with his son and listened to one of my lectures, I said: 'This is the nature of my teaching,' and then I fell silent. When he asked me to continue, I told him: 'Every art is tedious and difficult to the uninitiated while it is being learned. The finished product of an art immediately shows its use, but the process of creating it is often unattractive. You can watch a shoemaker learn his trade, and it is unpleasant; yet the shoe is useful. Watch a musician being taught; it is the most tiresome thing to observe, yet the result is sweet to the ear.' \n\nSo it is here. We imagine the work of the philosopher to be this: to bring his own will into harmony with happening events, so that nothing happens against our will and nothing we wish for fails to happen. The result of this is that those who master it do not fail in their desires, do not fall into what they avoid, and pass their lives without grief, fear, or disturbance. They maintain all their natural and acquired relationships—as son, father, brother, citizen, husband, neighbor, and fellow traveler. This is the work we imagine for the philosopher. \n\nNext, we ask: How is this achieved? We see that a carpenter becomes a carpenter by learning certain things. Is it enough here merely to wish to be good and noble, or must we learn something? The philosophers say we must first learn that God exists, that He provides for all things, and that you cannot hide from Him—not only your actions but even your thoughts. You must learn His nature: Is He faithful? Free? Beneficent? High-minded? Whatever nature He has, you must emulate it. If the Divine is faithful, you must be faithful. If free, you must be free. You must do and say everything as an imitator of God. \n\n'Where do I begin?' you ask. If you will sit down, I will tell you: First, you must understand the meaning of names and words. You say, 'Do I not understand them now?' No, you do not. You use them as illiterates use written signs, or as cattle use their senses—you use them, but you do not understand them. If you think you know, let us test ourselves. But you find it annoying to be cross-examined—you, an old man, perhaps a veteran of three campaigns. \n\nI know why you are annoyed. You came to me thinking you lacked nothing. What could you possibly lack? You are rich, you have children, a wife, many slaves; Caesar knows you; you have friends in Rome; you do your duty. What is missing? If I tell you that you lack the most necessary things for happiness—that you know neither God, nor man, nor Good, nor Evil, and, worst of all, you do not know *yourself*—how can you bear it? You leave immediately in a rage. \n\nYet, what harm have I done you? I am merely the mirror showing the ugly man his reflection. I am the doctor telling the patient: 'Sir, you think you are healthy, but you have a fever. Fast today, drink only water.' No one says, 'What terrible insolence!' to a doctor. But if I say to you: 'Your desires are inflamed, your aversions are low, your impulses are inconsistent with nature, your judgments are random and false,' you scream, 'He insulted me!' \n\nOur condition is like a festival. Cattle bring nothing to the fair but a concern for fodder. Those of you who care only for wealth, land, and slaves—you care only for fodder. But there are a few men in the crowd who are true spectators, lovers of the spectacle. They ask: 'What is the universe? Who governs it? Is there no ruler?' And seeing the order, they conclude there is a Governor. Who is He? We are His creation; why were we made? These few spend their time observing the festival before they depart. And what happens? They are laughed at by the crowd, just as the cattle—if they could speak—would laugh at those who admire the scenery instead of the grass.",
    "notes": "In Discourses 2.14, Epictetus addresses the difficulty of teaching Stoicism to worldly, successful people. The central theme is the distinction between external success (wealth, status, 'fodder') and internal cultivation (understanding the cosmos and one's own will). \n\n1. **The Process vs. The Product:** Epictetus begins by admitting that the *learning* of philosophy (logic, definitions, rigorous self-examination) is tedious to the outsider, much like watching a craftsman train. However, the *product*—a life free from grief, fear, and conflict—is universally desired. \n\n2. **Harmonizing the Will (Prohairesis):** The core definition of the philosopher's task is defined here: aligning one's individual will with the course of Nature (God's will). This ensures one never meets with disappointment, as they only desire what actually happens.\n\n3. **Imitating the Divine:** Practical ethics are grounded in theology. One cannot be a good person without understanding the nature of the Good (God). If God is faithful and free, the Stoic student must cultivate those same traits to function properly as a human being.\n\n4. **The Mirror and the Doctor:** A crucial pedagogical metaphor. The philosopher is not an entertainer but a physician of the soul. When Epictetus reveals the student's ignorance (specifically self-ignorance regarding their moral state), the student often reacts with anger rather than gratitude. Epictetus equates this to a patient getting angry at a doctor for diagnosing a fever.\n\n5. **The Festival (Panegyris):** This is one of the most famous Stoic metaphors for life. The universe is a festival we attend for a short time. Most people (compared to cattle) are distracted by trade, buying, selling, and consuming ('fodder'). The philosopher is the 'spectator' (philotheamon) whose sole purpose is to understand the nature of the spectacle and the character of the Festival Director (God) before departing.",

    "english": "Concerning those who cling obstinately to whatever decisions they have made. When some people hear these teachings—that one must be steadfast, that the will is by nature free and uncompelled, while all else is liable to hindrance and compulsion—they imagine that they must abide immutably by every judgment they have ever formed. But first, the judgment must be sound! I want strength in the body, yes, but the strength of a healthy man, an athlete. If you show me the convulsive strength of a frenzy, I say: 'Man, seek a doctor; this is not strength, but a breakdown of strength.' \n\nThose who misunderstand these teachings suffer a similar pathology of the soul. For example, a friend of mine once decided to starve himself to death for no reason. I learned of it on the third day of his abstinence, went to him, and asked what had happened. \n'I have decided,' he said. \n'But what was it that persuaded you? Tell me, for if you decided correctly, look, we are sitting here with you and will help you make your exit. But if you decided irrationally, change your mind.' \n'One must abide by one’s decisions,' he replied. \n'What are you doing, man? Not by all of them, but only by the right ones! If you are currently convinced that it is night, do not change your mind just because it appears otherwise; keep to it and say that one must abide by decisions! What are you doing? Do not build on rot.' \n\nWithout any cause, you are taking a friend and fellow citizen away from us, causing a death and destroying a man who has done no wrong, and yet you say, 'One must abide by decisions.' If it ever occurred to you to kill me, would you have to abide by that decision? With difficulty, that man was eventually persuaded; but there are some among us now whom there is no moving. I think I now understand the proverb I previously did not know: 'You can neither persuade nor break a fool.' God forbid that I should have a 'wise fool' for a friend; nothing is harder to handle. \n\n'I have decided,' you say. Do you not wish to act like a sick man and call the doctor? 'I am sick, sir; help me. Consider what I must do; it is my duty to obey you.' But here you say, 'I have decided.' What is greater or more urgent than for you to be convinced that it is not enough merely to have decided and not to change? These are manic tensions, not healthy ones. 'I wish to die, even if you compel me to live.' Why? 'I have decided.' 'I will not take money.' Why? 'I have decided.' This is exactly like the flux in a sick, rheumatic body—the humor inclines now here, now there. So it is with a weak soul: it is uncertain which way it will tilt; but when a rigid tension is added to this inclination and drifting, then the evil becomes past help and past cure.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus addresses a dangerous misinterpretation of Stoic 'constancy.' While Stoics value a firm and unshakeable character, this firmness must be rooted in Right Reason (Logos), not merely in the stubborn adherence to a past decision. Epictetus distinguishes between true strength (health) and the rigidity of madness (disease). A decision is only worth keeping if it is objectively sound; clinging to a false impression or an irrational judgment is not a virtue—it is a vice he calls a 'manic tension.' The true student is willing to treat their soul like a patient under a doctor's care, submitting their initial judgments to scrutiny rather than defending them simply because 'I have decided.' Rigidity without wisdom is fragility disguised as strength.",

    "english": "We fail to practice the application of our judgments concerning good and evil. Where does the Good lie? 'In the sphere of choice.' Where does Evil lie? 'In the sphere of choice.' And where lies that which is neither? 'In the sphere outside of choice.' Well then, does anyone among us remember these lessons outside of this room? Does anyone practice answering facts as they would questions? Is it day? Yes. Is it night? No. Are the stars equal in number? I cannot say. So, when money is shown to you, have you practiced giving the proper answer—that it is not a good? Why, then, are you surprised that where you have practiced, there you are stronger, but where you have remained unpracticed, you remain the same? \n\nConsider the orator: he knows he has written a good speech, he has memorized it, and he brings a pleasing voice to it, yet he is still anxious. Why? Because he is not satisfied merely with the practice of speaking. What does he want? To be praised. For when did he ever learn what praise is, or what blame is? When did he learn the nature of each? Or which kind of praise must be pursued and which blame avoided? When did he practice this discipline in accordance with our principles? Why are you surprised, then, that in the things he has learned, he excels, but in the things he has not practiced, he is no different from the mob? It is like a cithara-player: he knows how to play, sings well, and has a fine tunic, yet he trembles as he enters the stage. For he knows all about music, but he does not know what a 'crowd' is, nor what the shouting of a mob is, nor what mockery is. He does not know if this anxiety is our own work or something external, or if it is possible to stop it. Consequently, if he is praised, he leaves puffed up; if he is mocked, his little bubble is pricked and he collapses.\n\nWe suffer from the same condition. What do we admire? Externals. About what are we busy? Externals. And then we are perplexed as to why we are fearful or anxious! What else is possible when we consider impending events to be evils? We cannot help but fear; we cannot help but agonize. Then we say, 'Lord God, how may I not be anxious?' Fool, have you no hands? Did not God make them for you? Did He not give you greatness of soul? Did He not give you courage? With such hands, are you still looking for someone to wipe your nose? But we do not practice these things, nor do we pay attention to them. Give me one man who cares how he acts, who is concerned not with obtaining something, but with his own energy of action. Who, when walking, is concerned with the act of walking itself? Who, when deliberating, is concerned with the deliberation itself, and not with getting that for which he plans? \n\nAnd if he succeeds, he is elated and says, 'How well we planned!' Did I not tell you, brother, that it is impossible, if we have considered a matter correctly, for it not to turn out thus? But if the result is otherwise, he is humble and wretched. Who among us does not sleep soundly on these truths? Why then are you surprised that while we are well-practiced in material things, we are base, unseemly, worthless, cowardly, and miserable in our own moral purpose? We simply do not care, nor do we practice. If we feared not death or exile, but fear itself, then we would practice avoiding those things which appear to us as evils. But as it is, in the lecture hall we are articulate and brilliant; if a small question arises about these matters, we are capable of arguing it fully. But drag us into practical application, and you will find us miserable shipwrecks.\n\nLet a disturbing appearance crash upon us, and you will know what we have been practicing and for what we have been training. Because of this lack of practice, we always heap upon ourselves imagined terrors and make things appear greater than they are. Immediately, when I am at sea and look down into the deep or around at the open ocean and see no land, I am beside myself, imagining that I must drink up this whole sea if I am wrecked. It does not occur to me that three pints are enough to drown me. What is it, then, that disturbs me? The sea? No, my judgment about it. Again, when an earthquake happens, I imagine the whole city is about to fall on me; yet is not a single small stone enough to knock my brains out? What, then, are the things that weigh upon us and drive us out of our minds? What else but our judgments? For when a man goes away and parts from his companions, friends, and familiar places, what is it that weighs upon him but a judgment? Children cry when their nurse leaves them for a moment; but give them a cake, and they forget their sorrow. Do you wish us to be like children, then? No, by Zeus! I do not wish you to be comforted by a cake, but by true judgments. \n\nAnd what are these judgments? They are those which a man must practice all day long: not to be attached to what is not his own—neither to a companion, nor to a place, nor to a gymnasium, nor even to his own body—but to remember the Law and keep it before his eyes. What is the Divine Law? To keep what is your own, and not to lay claim to what belongs to others; to use what is given, and not to long for what is not given; and if something is taken away, to give it up readily and instantly, grateful for the time you had the use of it. Do you wish to cry for your nurse and your mommy? For what does it matter to what a man is enslaved, or on what he depends? How are you better than the one who cries for a girl, if you grieve for your little gymnasium, your colonnades, your young men, and such pastimes? Another comes and laments that he will no longer drink the water of Dirce. Is the Marcian water worse than that of Dirce? 'But I was used to the other.' And you will get used to this one in turn. And then, if you become attached to this one, go ahead and cry for it too, and try to write a verse like that of Euripides: 'The baths of Nero and the Marcian water!' See how tragedy is made when fools meet with everyday events!\n\nIf, however, you follow the Administrator of all things and carry Him within yourself, do you still long for stones and a pretty rock? When you are about to leave the sun and the moon themselves, what will you do? Will you sit and cry like a child? What, then, were you doing in the school? What did you hear? What did you learn? Why did you write 'Philosopher' on your forehead when you might have written the truth? 'I passed a few introductory courses.' For what part do you have in that which Socrates possessed, who died as he did, and lived as he did? Or what part in Diogenes? Do you imagine that any of them wept or was indignant because he was not going to see such-and-such a man, or such-and-such a woman, or be in Athens or Corinth, but rather in Susa or Ecbatana, if it so happened? For he who can leave the banquet whenever he pleases, and no longer play the game—does he vex himself while he stays? Does he not stay as one merely playing, only as long as he is amused? Such a man would easily endure exile or a sentence of death.\n\nWill you not, at last, be weaned like a child and take hold of more solid food, and stop crying for 'mamas' and 'nurses'—the lamentations of old women? 'But if I leave them, I shall make them sorrowful.' You will not make them sorrowful; but that which makes you sorrowful will make them so too—namely, judgment. Remove this, hack it off! Man, drive out this thing for the sake of a smooth flow of life, for the sake of freedom, for the sake of greatness of soul! Lift up your neck at last as one released from slavery. Dare to look up to God and say: 'Deal with me strictly henceforth as You will; I am of one mind with You; I am Yours. I refuse nothing that seems good to You. Lead me where You will; clothe me in what dress You will. Is it Your will that I should hold office, or remain a private man; stay here, or be in exile; be poor, or be rich? I will defend all these Your acts before men.' \n\nOr will you not do this? Then sit inside like a calf and wait for your mommy to feed you. Who would Hercules have been had he sat at home? He would have been Eurystheus, not Hercules! But as he traveled the world, how many friends and acquaintances did he have? Yet nothing was dearer to him than God. Because of this, he was believed to be the son of Zeus, and so he was. Obedient to Him, he went about purging away injustice and lawlessness. But you are not Hercules, and you cannot purge away the evils of others; you are not even Theseus, to purge the evils of Attica. Clear away your own! Cast out from your mind—not Procrustes and Sciron—but grief, fear, desire, envy, malice, avarice, effeminacy, intemperance. These things cannot be cast out unless you look to God alone, unless you fix your affection on Him alone, and are consecrated to His commands. If you wish for anything else, you will follow what is stronger than you, sighing and groaning, always seeking happiness outside yourself, and never able to find it. For you seek it where it is not, and you neglect to seek it where it is.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus addresses the fundamental disconnect between Stoic theory and actual practice (meletē). \n\n1. **The Gap in Training**: He criticizes students who can perfectly define 'Good' and 'Evil' as residing solely in the Will (prohairesis), yet who panic when faced with real-world externals like money, public opinion, or exile. He uses the analogy of a musician who knows the notes but suffers stage fright because he mistakes the nature of the audience (an indifferent external) for something fearsome.\n\n2. **The Nature of Anxiety**: Anxiety arises from a false judgment. We fear the 'sea' or the 'earthquake,' but physically, a small amount of water or a single stone is enough to kill us. The terror comes not from the object, but from our mental amplification of it. We project value onto things that have none, and thus we become slaves to them.\n\n3. **Attachment vs. The Divine Law**: Epictetus mocks homesickness and attachment to specific places (Athens, the baths) or people (nurses, parents) as childish. The 'Divine Law' is to enjoy what is present but surrender it instantly without grief when the universe claims it back. To cling to specifics is to violate the nature of the cosmos.\n\n4. **The Inner Hercules**: The hero Hercules is presented as the ultimate model of the Cosmopolitan. He did not sit at home missing his mother; he roamed the world serving God and clearing away monsters. While we cannot clear the world of monsters, we have a duty to perform the 'Herculean task' internally: purging our own minds of the monsters of grief, envy, and fear. This internal cleansing is the only path to 'euroia' (the smooth flow of life).",

    "english": "How must we adapt our preconceptions to particular cases? What is the first task of one who philosophizes? To cast away self-conceit. For it is impossible for a man to begin to learn that which he thinks he already knows. We all come to the philosophers babbling about what should and should not be done, about good and bad, noble and base. We praise, we blame, we accuse, we find fault, and we judge practice as honorable or shameful. Why, then, do we come to the philosophers at all? It is ridiculous to think that we wish to learn what we think we already know! No, we come wanting to learn specifics, but in reality, we hope to make progress in things we haven't actually studied. This is exactly what deceives the masses, just as it did the rhetorician Theopompus when he criticized Plato for wishing to define every term. What does he say? 'Did none of us before you talk about the Good or the Just? Did we utter these sounds as empty noise without understanding what they meant?' By no means! Who tells you, Theopompus, that we do not have natural concepts and preconceptions of each of these? But it is impossible to apply these preconceptions to corresponding realities without having first dissected them and considered what specific substance belongs to each. You might as well say the same to physicians: 'Who among us did not speak of the healthy and the sickly before Hippocrates was born?' But we have a preconception of 'healthy' that we cannot apply. One doctor says, 'abstain from food,' another says 'give food'; one says 'bleed him,' another 'cup him.' And so it is here in life. Who among us does not talk of Good and Bad, advantageous and disadvantageous? But do we possess these distinct and perfect? Show me! How? By this: that we do not disagree. If you apply the preconception of 'wealth' to the heading of 'good,' and another does not, are you not fighting? It is the same with pleasure and health. If we all knew these things perfectly, what need would we have for fighting or blaming one another? But now, look at your own state. You apply your preconceptions, yet you are hindered and distressed. Let us leave aside the Second Field of study regarding impulses and duties, and the Third regarding assents. I grant you those. Let us stay on the First Field: desire and aversion. Do you desire what is possible? Why then are you hindered? Why are you miserable? You fall into what you want to avoid. Why? Because you desire things that are not yours. This is the greatest proof of misery and ill-fortune: 'I want something and it does not happen.' Is there anything more wretched? This is what Medea could not endure, and so she came to kill her children. She had a distinct impression that it was advantageous to punish her husband, but she failed to apply her preconceptions correctly because she was blinded by passion. She did not know where the power to do what we want truly lies—that it is not in externals. Do not want your husband at all costs; do not want to stay in Corinth; simply want nothing other than what God wants. Who then will hinder you? No one, any more than they can hinder Zeus. Give up your desire for wealth, health, office, honors, friends, children—for anything not up to you. Hand them over to Zeus and the other gods; let them govern. If you envy, pity, are jealous, tremble, and never cease complaining about yourself and the gods, how can you claim to be educated? What education? That you have learned syllogisms? Will you not unlearn all that and begin from the beginning, realizing that you have never touched the real matter? Give me one young man who has come to school with this purpose: to become an athlete of this matter, saying, 'To me, let all other things go; it is enough if I can live without hindrance and sorrow, and look up to heaven as a friend of God, fearing nothing that can happen.' Come, young man, into your own! These things are yours; you were born to adorn philosophy. But instead, when you have merely labored at the text, you say, 'I want to be free from passion, but I also want to know what Chrysippus says in his treatise on The Liar.' Wretched man! It is not enough to be like a drunkard or a sleeper? You must read Chrysippus too? This is why you must throw away the conceit that you know anything useful and come to philosophy as we come to geometry or music. Otherwise, even if we read all the collections of Chrysippus, Antipater, and Archedemus, we shall not even be near to making progress.",
    "notes": "This section of the Discourses (2.17) is a critical lesson on 'Preconceptions' (Prolepseis) and the sequence of moral training. Epictetus argues that all humans possess innate, general ideas of 'Good' and 'Bad,' but our misery stems from misapplying these general labels to specific, external events (Particulars). The 'First Task' of the student is to remove 'Oiesis' (conceit/arrogance)—the false belief that we already know how to live. Without humility, learning is impossible. He cites the tragedy of Medea not as a lack of knowledge of what is generally 'advantageous,' but as a catastrophic failure to apply that concept correctly due to passion; she thought revenge (an external result) was more advantageous than moral integrity. Epictetus then reiterates his famous 'Three Topoi' (Fields of Study), insisting that students must master the First Field (Desire and Aversion—disciplining the will to align with Nature/God) before moving to the Second (Action/Duty) or the Third (Logic/Assent). He mocks students who rush to study complex logic (Chrysippus) while remaining emotional slaves to envy and fear. The lesson is practical: intellectual knowledge of Stoic physics or logic is useless if you still blame God or others for your misfortunes. True philosophy begins with the admission of ignorance regarding how to live.",

    "english": "How must we struggle against impressions? Every habit and faculty is maintained and increased by the corresponding actions: the habit of walking by walking, the habit of running by running. If you want to be a reader, read; if a writer, write. But if you do not read for thirty days in a row, but do something else, you will see what happens. So it is: if you lie in bed for ten days, then get up and try to walk a rather long distance, you will see how your legs totter. Generally, then, if you want to do something, make a habit of it; if you want not to do something, do not do it, but apply yourself to something else instead. The same principle holds true for the affairs of the soul. When you are angry, know that you have not merely done this specific evil, but you have also strengthened the habit and added fuel to the fire. When you are defeated by someone in sexual temptation, do not reckon this as a single defeat, but know that you have fed your incontinence and strengthened it. For it is impossible that habits and faculties should not result from corresponding actions, either implanting them where they did not exist, or intensifying and strengthening them where they did. This is exactly how philosophers say that infirmities of the soul grow up. For when you have once desired money, if reason is applied to lead you to a perception of the evil, the desire is checked and the governing faculty recovers its authority; but if you apply no remedy, it does not return to its former state, but when it is next excited by the corresponding impression, it is inflamed by desire more rapidly than before. And when this happens continually, a callus is formed, and the infirmity confirms the avarice. For he who has had a fever and is then relieved is not in the same state as he was before, unless he has been completely cured. Something similar happens with the passions of the soul. Certain traces and welts are left behind in it, which, unless a man erases them perfectly, become not welts but open wounds when he is flogged again on the same spots. If, therefore, you wish not to be of an angry temper, do not feed the habit; throw nothing to it which will tend to its increase. At first, keep quiet, and count the days on which you were not angry. 'I used to get angry every day, then every other day, then every third, then every fourth.' But if you have missed as many as thirty days, offer a sacrifice to God. For the habit is first weakened and then utterly destroyed. 'I was not vexed today, nor the next day, nor for two or three months after; but I took heed when some provoking things happened.' Today when I saw a handsome person, I did not say to myself, 'O that I could possess her!' and 'Happy is her husband!' for he who says this says also, 'Happy is the adulterer!' nor did I go on to picture the next scene: her presence, her disrobing, her lying down beside me. I pat myself on the head and say, 'Well done, Epictetus! You have solved a clever sophism, much cleverer than the Master Argument.' But if the woman is willing, and signals to me, and sends for me, and clings to me, and I still hold aloof and conquer—this is a sophism greater than 'The Liar' or 'The Resting Man.' This is something to be proud of, not the proposing of the Master Argument. How then may this be done? Will to please yourself at last; will to appear beautiful to God! Desire to be pure in the presence of your pure Self and of God. And when an impression of this sort assails you, go, as Plato says, to the expiatory sacrifices; go as a suppliant to the shrines of the averting deities; it is enough even if you withdraw to the society of good and noble men, and compare yourself with them, whether living or dead. Go to Socrates and see him lying beside Alcibiades, yet making light of his beauty. Consider what a victory he won, conscious of having conquered himself—an Olympic victory! So that, by heaven, one might justly salute him, 'Hail, wondrous man!' opposing this to those rotten boxers and pancratiasts and the gladiators who resemble them. By placing these objects against the other, you will conquer the impression; you will not be drawn away by it. But in the first place, do not be hurried away by the intensity of the impression, but say, 'Wait for me a little, O Impression; allow me to see who you are, and what you are an impression of; allow me to put you to the test.' And afterwards, do not suffer it to lead you on and paint the next scene for you; if you do, it will take you and carry you away wherever it pleases. But rather, introduce some other beautiful and noble impression, and cast out this filthy one. If you accustom yourself to this kind of training, you will see what shoulders you will get, what sinews, what vigor; but now you have only distinct little words and nothing more. This is the true athlete, the man who exercises himself against such impressions. Stay, wretch, do not be swept away! The struggle is great, the task is divine; it is for kingship, for freedom, for serenity, for peace. Remember God; call upon Him as helper and protector, as men at sea call upon the Dioscuri in a storm. For what storm is greater than that which arises from violent impressions that drive out reason? For what is the storm itself but an impression? For take away the fear of death, and bring as much thunder and lightning as you please, and you will know what calm and fair weather there is in the ruling faculty. But if you are once defeated and say that you will conquer hereafter, and then do the same thing again, know that you will at last be in so wretched and weak a condition that you will not even know afterwards that you are sinning, but you will even begin to make apologies for the thing, and then you will confirm the truth of Hesiod's saying, that 'with the man who puts off his work, disaster wrestles.'",
    "notes": "This section is Epictetus's masterclass on the psychology of habit (hexis) and the practical mechanics of virtue. 1. The Physiology of Vice: Epictetus rejects the idea that a moral error is an isolated event. He views character as 'muscle memory.' Every time you get angry or lustful, you aren't just committing a sin; you are physically reinforcing a neural pathway (to use modern terms) or feeding a fire. The 'welts' and 'wounds' analogy emphasizes that the soul retains scars from past passions, making it hypersensitive to future provocations. 2. The Discipline of Assent: The core technique here is handling 'phantasiai' (impressions). The untrained mind immediately assents to a vivid impression (e.g., a beautiful body implies 'sex would be good'). Epictetus teaches the 'Pause': 'Wait for me a little, Impression.' By arresting the immediate reaction, you insert a gap where Reason (the ruling faculty) can inspect the data. 3. Displacement and Visualization: He suggests 'counter-phantasia.' You cannot just suppress a thought; you must displace it with a stronger, nobler image. He urges the student to visualize Socrates or call upon God, effectively using role models to shame the base impulse into submission. 4. The Superiority of Character over Logic: Epictetus mocks the academic obsession with logical puzzles like 'The Master Argument' or 'The Liar.' He asserts that the true philosopher's 'sophism' to solve is not a logic game, but the real-world puzzle of resisting temptation. 5. The Danger of Procrastination: The excerpt ends with a dire warning. Postponing virtue ('I'll be good tomorrow') leads to a state of 'moral unawareness,' where the sinner no longer even realizes they are sinning, having lost the capacity for self-correction.",

    "english": "Regarding those who embrace the teachings of philosophers only as far as the words go: The 'Master Argument' appears to have been propounded based on some such premises as these. Since there is a common contradiction among the following three propositions—(1) 'Everything past is necessarily true,' (2) ' The impossible does not follow from the possible,' and (3) 'There is something possible which neither is nor will be true'—contradicting each other, a person might keep two of them but must reject the third. Diodorus, for instance, kept the first two but claimed that nothing is possible which neither is nor will be true. Others maintain the other two, and others still a different pair. But to keep all three is impossible because of their mutual conflict.\n\nNow, if someone asks me, 'But which of them do you maintain?' I answer: 'I do not know; but I have received this account—that Diodorus maintained one view, and the followers of Panthoides and Cleanthes another, and Chrysippus yet another.' 'But you, what do you say?' 'I was never made for this; to test my own impressions, to compare the statements of philosophers, to form a judgment of my own.' Instead, I am like a student reciting history: 'Who was Hector's father?' 'Priam.' 'Who were his brothers?' 'Alexander and Deiphobus.' 'And their mother?' 'Hecuba.' I have received this story from Homer; Hellanicus writes about the same things, and perhaps others of that sort.\n\nAnd so it is with me regarding the Master Argument; what do I have that is any better? But if I am a vain person, I astound the guests at a banquet by enumerating the authors who have written on it: 'Chrysippus wrote marvelously in his first book on Possibilities; Cleanthes wrote a special treatise on this subject, and Archedemus too. Antipater also wrote, not only in his books on Possibilities but specifically in his treatise on the Master Argument. Have you not read the work?' 'I have not.' 'Read it!'\n\nAnd in all this, what benefit comes from merely mastering the history and adopting no judgment of one’s own? But in ethical matters, our condition is much worse than in logic. Tell me about Good and Evil. Listen: 'Of things, some are good, some bad, some indifferent. The virtues and things sharing in them are good; vices and things sharing in them are bad; what lies between—wealth, health, life, death, pleasure, pain—is indifferent.'\n\n'How do you know this?' 'Hellanicus says so in his History of Egypt.' For what difference does it make whether you recite this from the philosophers or from a history book, if you simply utter words? Because, show me how you behave in a storm on a ship. Do you remember this logical distinction when the sails crack? If some mischievous fellow stands by you while you scream and says, 'Tell me, by the gods, what you were saying just now: Is any vice present here? Surely shipwreck isn't a vice?'—would you not pick up a piece of wood and strike him? 'What have we to do with you, man? We are perishing, and you come to make jokes!'\n\nOr if Caesar summons you to answer an accusation, do you remember the distinction? If someone approaches you—pale and trembling as you enter—and says, 'Why do you tremble, man? What is this business about? Does Caesar inside present virtue and vice to those who enter?' You will say, 'Why do you mock me? As if I didn't have enough misery of my own.' 'But tell me, philosopher, why do you tremble? Is it not merely death that is in danger, or prison, or bodily pain, or exile, or disgrace? Is it anything else?' 'No.' 'Then is it any vice? Or anything that partakes of vice?' 'What do you want with me, man? My own evils are enough for me.'\n\nAnd so you clearly show: 'Rightly did I not maintain these doctrines; I did not study them; they were not my own judgments; I just picked them up from the roadside.' Examine yourselves in your actions, and you will find to what sect you belong. You will find most of you are Epicureans; a few are Peripatetics, and those physically limp. For where is the proof that you consider virtue equal to all other things, or even superior? Show me a Stoic, if you have one!\n\nWhere or how? Oh, you can show me thousands who recite the Stoic distinctions. But do they recite Epicurean doctrines any worse? Do they not handle the Peripatetic arguments with equal precision? Who, then, is a Stoic? As we call a statue Phidian if it is molded according to the art of Phidias, so show me someone molded according to the judgments he utters. Show me a man who is sick and happy, in danger and happy, dying and happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy. Show him! By the gods, I long to see a Stoic!\n\nBut you cannot show me one fully modeled; then show me one who is in the process of being modeled, one who has leaned in that direction. Do me a kindness; do not grudge an old man a sight he has never yet seen. Do you think I want you to show me the Zeus of Phidias or his Athena—a construct of ivory and gold? No, let one of you show me a human soul willing to be of one mind with God, blaming neither God nor man, failing in nothing he attempts, falling into nothing he avoids, never angry, never envious, never jealous—why must I use circumlocutions?—one who desires to become a god from a man, and in this dead body of flesh is mindful of his fellowship with Zeus. Show him to me! But you cannot.\n\nWhy, then, do you mock yourselves and cheat others? Why do you walk around wearing a mask not your own, like thieves and clothes-stealers, claiming names and deeds that do not belong to you? Now, I am your teacher, and you are being taught by me. I have this ambition: to make you unhindered, unconstrained, unimpeded, free, prosperous, happy, looking to God in everything small and great. And you are here to learn and practice these things. Why, then, do you not complete the work? If you have the right ambition and I have the right qualification, what is missing?\n\nWhen I see a carpenter and the wood is present, I expect the work. Here, the carpenter is here, the wood is here; what do we lack? Is the matter not teachable? It is. Is it not in our power? Nay, it is the only thing in the universe that is. Neither wealth nor health nor reputation is in our power, but only the correct use of impressions. This alone is by nature unhindered; this alone is unimpeded. Why then do you not finish the task? Tell me the cause. It lies either in me, or in you, or in the nature of the thing. But the thing itself is possible and uniquely in our power. It remains, then, that the fault lies in me or in you, or—more truly—in both. Do you wish, then, that we begin at last to bring such an ambition here? Let us leave the past alone. Let us only begin, believe me, and you shall see.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus attacks the 'Academic' approach to Stoicism—treating it as a purely intellectual exercise rather than a lived discipline. \n\n1. **The Master Argument (Kyrieuon Logos):** Epictetus begins with high-level logic to bait the trap. The students feel proud discussing complex logical puzzles about necessity and possibility. However, Epictetus reveals that memorizing the logic of Diodorus or Chrysippus is useless if one acts like a frightened child in the face of life's difficulties.\n\n2. **Theory vs. Practice (Askēsis):** The core indictment is that the students know the definition of 'Indifferents' (adiaphora)—that health, wealth, and reputation are neither good nor bad—but they do not *believe* it. In a storm or before a tyrant, their visceral reactions (fear, trembling) prove their true philosophy is Epicurean (seeking safety/pleasure) or Peripatetic (valuing externals), not Stoic.\n\n3. **The True Stoic:** Epictetus provides a famous definition of a Stoic here. It is not someone who writes books or solves logic puzzles. It is the person who can be 'sick and happy, in danger and happy, dying and happy.' This is the 'statue' he wants to see—a soul molded by reason to be in harmony with the Divine Will (Zeus), completely immune to external coercion.\n\n4. **The Teacher's Plea:** The passage ends with a rousing call to action. The transformation of the self is the *only* thing truly in our power (prohairesis). Since the materials (the students) and the craftsman (the teacher) are present, the failure is a failure of will. He urges them to stop reciting and start *becoming*.",

    "english": "Regarding the Epicureans and Academics: Observe how even those who oppose distinct and evident truths are compelled to make use of them. Indeed, one might find this the strongest proof that a thing is evident: that even the man who denies it is forced to utilize it. For instance, if a man argues that 'there is no universal truth,' he has clearly committed himself to the contradictory proposition: for he has asserted a universal truth by stating that no universal truth exists. Slave, admit it! What else is this but to say, 'If anything is universal, it is false'? Again, if someone comes forward and says, 'Know this: nothing can be known, but everything is uncertain; believe me and you will benefit,' he is contradictory. He says, 'Learn from me, O man, that it is impossible to learn anything.' He says, 'I tell you this and I will teach you, if you wish.' How do these men differ from those—who are they?—who call themselves Academics? 'O men, agree that no one agrees on anything; believe us that no one believes anyone.' Thus also Epicurus: when he wishes to abolish the natural fellowship of men with one another, he uses the very thing he destroys. For what does he say? 'Do not be deceived, men, nor led astray, nor mistaken: there is no natural fellowship among rational beings; believe me. Those who say otherwise deceive you and reason falsely.' Why then do you care? Let us be deceived! Will you be any worse off if all the rest of us are persuaded that we have a natural fellowship with one another and that we must guard it by every means? Nay, your life will be much better and safer. Man, why do you worry about us? Why do you stay awake for our sakes? Why do you light your lamp? Why do you rise early? Why do you write such massive books? Is it lest some of us be deceived concerning the gods, thinking that they care for men? or lest we suppose the nature of the Good to be something other than Pleasure? For if this is the case, lie down and sleep, and do the work of a worm, for which you have judged yourself worthy: eat, drink, copulate, defecate, and snore. What does it matter to you how others think about these matters, whether soundly or unsoundly? What are we to you? Do you care about the sheep because they offer themselves to be shorn and milked and finally slaughtered? Would it not be desirable if men could be lulled and enchanted by the Stoics into slumber, offering themselves to you and your kind to be shorn and milked? You ought to say these things to your fellow Epicureans only and conceal them from outsiders, focusing on distinct groups to maintain this lack of fellowship. But what roused him from his bed and compelled him to write what he wrote? It was that which is strongest in men: Nature! She drags a man to her will even if he is unwilling and groaning. 'Since,' she says, 'you hold these unsocial opinions, write them down and leave them to others; stay awake for them, and by your own actions become the accuser of your own doctrines.' We say that Orestes was driven from his sleep by Furies; are the Furies and Avenging Spirits not harsher for this man? They roused him as he slept and would not let him rest, but compelled him to proclaim his own miseries, just as wine and madness force the Galli. So strong and unconquerable is human nature. How can a vine move not like a vine, but like an olive tree? Or an olive tree not like an olive, but like a vine? It is impossible, inconceivable. Therefore, neither is it possible for a man to lose the motions of a man entirely; and those who cut off their bodily desires cannot cut off the desires of their nature. Thus Epicurus cut off all that belongs to a man, a master of a house, a citizen, and a friend, but the desires of human nature he could not cut off; for he could not, any more than the lazy Academics can cast away or blind their own senses, though they have tried their hardest to do so. What a misfortune! What do you say, philosopher? What does piety and holiness seem to you? 'If you wish, I will prove that it is good.' Do you have proofs then? 'Since these things please you greatly, take the contrary: that the gods do not exist, or if they do, they do not care for men, nor have we any fellowship with them; and this piety and holiness widely spoken of by the many is a lie of impostors and sophists, or by Zeus, of legislators to frighten and restrain wrongdoers.' Well done, philosopher! You have benefited our citizens; you have recovered the young who were already inclining to despise the divine. 'What then? Do these things not please you? Learn now how justice is nothing, how shame is folly, how a father is nothing, how a son is nothing.' Well done, philosopher! Continue, persuade the young, that we may have more who think and speak like you. From such arguments our well-governed cities grew; Sparta was founded because of such arguments; Lycurgus established his laws and education on these beliefs: that slavery is no more base than noble, nor freedom more noble than base! Those who died at Thermopylae died for these doctrines! And for what other principles did the Athenians leave their city? And yet, the men who say these things marry and beget children and engage in politics and appoint themselves priests and prophets. Of whom? Of gods that do not exist! And they question the Pythia to hear lies, and interpret oracles to others. O what great shamelessness and imposture! Man, what are you doing? You refute yourself every day and yet you will not give up these frigid arguments? When you eat, where do you carry your hand? To your mouth or to your eye? When you bathe, where do you step? When do you call the pot a dish or the ladle a skewer? If I were a slave to one of these men, even if I had to be flayed by him daily, I would torture him. 'Throw a little oil into the bath, boy.' I would take brine and pour it over his head. 'What is this?' 'An impression came to me, indistinguishable from oil, very like it, by your fortune!' 'Give me the porridge.' I would bring him a bowl of vinegar. 'Did I not ask for porridge?' 'Yes, master, this is porridge.' 'Is it not vinegar?' 'Why is it vinegar more than porridge?' 'Take it and smell it, take it and taste it.' 'How do you know if the senses do not deceive us?' If I had three or four fellow-slaves who agreed, I would make him hang himself or change his mind. But now they mock us, using all the gifts of nature while abolishing them in words. Grateful and modest men, indeed! If nothing else, while eating their daily bread they dare to say, 'We do not know if there is a Demeter or a Kore or a Pluto.' Not to mention that while enjoying the night and day, the seasons, the stars, the sea, the earth, and the cooperation of men, they are not moved in the slightest. What will they say, and about what, and to whom, and what will they gain from these arguments? They do not care. They do not worry that some noble youth might hear these words and be corrupted, losing all seeds of nobility; or that we might give a pretext to an adulterer to be shameless in his deeds; or that a embezzler of public funds might find a defense in these arguments; or that someone neglecting his parents might gain confidence from them. What then is good or bad, base or noble to you? This or that? Does anyone still debate with these men, or give them a reason, or try to persuade them? By Zeus, one might have better hope of persuading catamites to change their ways than those who have become so deaf and blind to their own evils.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus attacks the intellectual dishonesty of Skeptics (Academics) and Epicureans. The core lesson is that philosophy must align with Reality and Nature. 1) The 'Performative Contradiction': You cannot argue against the validity of the senses without using your senses to make the argument. You cannot argue against the human social impulse (as Epicurus does) without manifesting that very impulse by trying to 'save' others from error through your writing. 2) Nature is inescapable: Just as a vine acts as a vine, a human must act as a human. We are biologically and psychologically wired for sense-perception and social cooperation. Denying this in theory while relying on it in practice (eating, bathing, warning others) is not profound; it is absurd and ungrateful. 3) The danger of bad theory: Ideas have consequences. If you teach that there are no gods, no natural justice, and no objective truth, you dissolve the glue of society (as seen in Sparta or Athens) and encourage individual vice. A true philosopher aligns their doctrine with the evident necessities of life.",

    "english": "Concerning Inconsistency. Men readily admit to some faults, yet refuse to admit others. No one will confess to being a fool or without understanding; quite the contrary, you will hear everyone say, 'If only I had luck to match my brains!' They readily admit to being cowardly, saying, 'I am a bit timid, I confess,' but you will not find anyone admitting to being foolish. Neither will a man readily admit to being intemperate, and certainly not unjust—never! Envious? Hardly. Meddlesome? Not at all. Yet most will claim to be compassionate. \n\nWhat is the cause of this? The primary cause is a chaotic inconsistency regarding what is good and what is evil. They deny whatever they imagine to be shameful. But they view cowardice and pity as marks of a good-natured disposition, whereas they consider stupidity to be the mark of a slave. Furthermore, they do not consider their social offenses to be voluntary. They are most willing to admit to faults wherein they imagine some element of involuntariness exists—as with cowardice or pity. If a man admits to being intemperate, he blames it on 'love,' expecting forgiveness for something he deems involuntary. But injustice? They never imagine that as involuntary. There is, they think, something involuntary in jealousy, so they might admit to that too.\n\nLiving among such men—so confused, so ignorant of what they are saying, or what evils they possess, or whence they have them, or how to be rid of them—I ask you, is it not worth asking yourself constantly: 'Am I too one of these? What is my impression of myself? How do I treat myself? Do I conduct myself as a wise and self-controlled man? Do I say these things simply because I have learned to define them?' Do I possess the necessary perception that I know nothing? Do I come to the teacher as if to an oracle, prepared to obey? Or do I enter the schoolroom with a runny nose, seeking only to learn history and understand books I did not understand before, so that I may explain them to others?\n\nMan! You have been fighting with your little slave at home, you have turned the house upside down, you have disturbed the neighbors; and now you come to me, composing your robes like a sage, sitting there judging how I interpret a word, or criticizing how I rambled! You have come full of envy and humiliation because nothing has been sent to you from home. You sit through the lecture thinking of nothing but your father or your brother: 'What are they saying about me back there? They think I am making progress. I wish I could learn everything and return, but it is hard work, no money comes, the baths in Nicopolis are filthy, and life is wretched here and wretched at home.'\n\nThen people say, 'No one benefits from the school.' Why are you surprised? You carry out of here exactly what you brought in! You did not come to lay aside your opinions or correct them. You did not come to exchange them for others. Far from it! You look rather to see if you are getting what you came for. You want to chatter about theorems. Well? Do you not become a greater chatterbox? Do these theorems not provide you with material for showing off? You analyze syllogisms and hypothetical arguments. Why are you angry, then, if you receive exactly what you came for?\n\n'Yes, but if my child dies, or my brother, or if I must die or be tortured, what good are these things?' You did not come for that! You did not sit by my side for that purpose; you did not light your lamp or stay awake at night for that. When you went out for a walk, did you ever propose to yourself a moral impression instead of a syllogism to analyze with your friends? Never! Then you say the theorems are useless. If you ask me now, 'Are syllogisms useful?' I will answer that they are, and if you wish, I will prove it. 'But have they helped me?' Man, ask a distinct question! Let a man with dysentery ask me if vinegar is useful; I will say yes. 'Is it useful to me?' No.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus exposes the deep cognitive dissonance of the average student. The central theme is 'Anomologia'—inconsistency or lack of acknowledgement of one's true state. Epictetus observes that people only admit to faults they consider 'noble' or 'involuntary' (like pity or love-induced passion) because they fundamentally misunderstand the nature of Good and Evil. They view moral failure (injustice, intemperance) as voluntary and shameful, so they deny it, yet they view intellectual failure (stupidity) as slavish. \n\nThe lesson shifts to the role of the philosophical school. Epictetus views the school as a hospital ('iatreion') for the soul, not an academy for trivia. The students are criticized for compartmentalizing their lives: they act like tyrants at home (beating slaves, disturbing neighbors) and then come to the lecture hall to critique grammatical interpretations of texts. This is the definition of a failed education. True Stoicism requires bringing one's character into the school to be operated upon, not just one's intellect to be entertained. \n\nThe final metaphor of the 'dysenteric man' and the vinegar is crucial: Logic (vinegar) is a potent tool, but it is sharp and harsh. It is useful for a healthy mind to preserve truth, but for a soul sick with passion (dysentery), it is useless or even harmful. One must cure the sickness of character before handling the sharp tools of logic.",

It belongs only to the wise man to love. 'But how is this?' someone says. 'I am foolish, yet I love my child.' I marvel, by the gods, that you admit to being foolish in the first place! For what are you lacking? Do you not use your senses? Do you not distinguish between impressions? Do you not provide your body with food, clothing, and shelter? Why then do you admit to being a fool? Because, by Zeus, you are constantly carried away by your impressions and are disturbed; the persuasiveness of things overcomes you. At one moment you believe these things are good, then later the very same things seem evil, and later still indifferent. In short, you grieve, you fear, you envy, you are confused, you change. This is why you confess yourself a fool. And do you not change in your loving? Do you not consider wealth, pleasure, and things in general to be good at one moment and bad at another? Do you not view the same people sometimes as good, sometimes as bad? Sometimes you treat them kindly, sometimes hostilely; sometimes you praise them, sometimes you blame them? 'Yes, I undergo all this.' Well then, does the man who is deceived about someone seem to you to be his friend? 'Not at all.' Or the man who selects a friend subject to change? 'No.' Or the man who reviles someone now, but admires him later? 'No.' Have you never seen puppies fawning on each other and playing, so that you say nothing could be friendlier? But throw a piece of meat in the middle, and you will know what that friendship amounts to. Throw a bit of land between you and your son, and you will see how quickly he wishes to bury you, and how you pray for him to die. You will say, 'What a creature I have raised! He has been burying me for a long time!' Throw a pretty girl between you, and the old man loves her, and the young man loves her too; and if it is a bit of glory, or a risk to be run, you will speak the words of the father of Admetus: 'You love the light; do you think your father does not?' Do you think he did not love his own child when he was small? Did he not suffer when the boy had a fever, and say, 'Would that I had the fever instead'? But when the test comes, reality exposes the lie. Eteocles and Polynices—were they not from the same mother and father? Were they not raised together, did they not live together, drink together, sleep together, and often kiss one another? So that anyone seeing them would have laughed at the philosophers for saying paradoxes about friendship. But when the kingdom fell between them like a piece of meat, see what they said! For generally—make no mistake about this—every living creature is attached to nothing so strongly as to its own interest. Whatever appears to hinder this interest, whether it be brother, father, child, beloved, or lover, the creature hates, accuses, and curses it. For nothing is so naturally loved as one's own interest: this is father, and brother, and family, and country, and God. When the gods seem to hinder us in this, we revile even them and burn their temples, just as Alexander ordered the temples of Asclepius to be burned when his beloved died. Therefore, if a man places his interest in the same sphere as sanctity, virtue, country, parents, and friends, all these are secured; but if he places his interest in one place and his friends and country and justice in another, all these are outweighed by his interest and are lost. For wherever the 'I' and the 'Mine' are placed, to that place the creature necessarily inclines. If I am in the flesh, then my interest is there; if I am in my will, it is there; if in externals, it is there. If, therefore, I identify 'myself' with my moral will, only then shall I be a friend, a son, and a father as I ought. For it will be my interest to maintain my character as faithful, modest, patient, abstinent, and cooperative; it will be my interest to preserve my relationships. But if I place myself in one scale and the Good in the other, then the argument of Epicurus becomes strong, declaring that the Good is either nothing or else just the opinion of the crowd. Due to this ignorance, Athenians and Spartans quarreled, and Thebans with both, and the Great King with Greece, and Macedonians with both, and now Romans with Getae; and in earlier times the wars at Troy happened for this reason. Alexander was the guest of Menelaus; and if anyone had seen them being hospitable to one another, he would not have believed anyone saying they were not friends. But a little piece of meat was thrown in the middle—a pretty woman—and about her came the war. And now, when you see friends or brothers who seem to be of one mind, do not pronounce upon their friendship immediately, not even if they swear oaths, not even if they say it is impossible for them to part. The ruling faculty of a base man is not to be trusted; it is unstable, unjudging, conquered now by one impression, now by another. Do not ask if they were born of the same parents or raised by the same tutor, but ask only this: where do they place their interest? In externals or in the will? If in externals, do not call them friends, any more than you call them faithful, or stable, or courageous, or free; do not even call them human beings, if you have any sense. For it is not a human judgment that makes them bite one another, revile one another, and occupy deserts or marketplaces to destroy each other. But if you hear that these men truly believe the Good lies only where the will is, and where the right use of impressions is, then inquiring no further, declare confidently that they are friends, just as you declare them faithful and just. For where else is friendship than where faith is, where shame is, where there is an exchange of the noble, and of nothing else? 'But,' you say, 'he has treated me kindly for so long; and did he not love me?' Fool, how do you know if he treats you kindly only as he cleans his shoes or tends to his beast? How do you know that if you lose your utility as a sort of distinct vessel, he will not throw you away like a broken pot? 'But she is my wife and we have lived together so long.' Indeed, but a necklace came between you. And what is a necklace? It is the judgment held regarding such things. It was the bestial element, the thing that cuts friendship, the thing that does not allow a woman to be a wife or a mother. Let any of you who is serious about being a friend to himself or to another cut out these judgments, hate them, and drive them from his soul. Thus, he will first not revile himself, not fight with himself, not repent, not torture himself; and then he will treat his neighbor in the same way. He will be patient with the one unlike him, gentle, mild, and forgiving as toward one who is ignorant and misses the mark in the greatest matters; he will be harsh with no one, knowing well the words of Plato, that 'every soul is deprived of the truth against its will.' But if you do not do this, you will do everything else that friends do—you will drink together, live under the same roof, sail together, and be born of the same parents—but you will be like snakes sharing a sack: neither they nor you are friends as long as you hold these bestial and filthy judgments.",
    "notes": "In this Discourse, Epictetus dissects the nature of Friendship (Philia) through the lens of Stoic psychology. The core lesson is the 'Law of Self-Interest': biological beings are hard-wired to pursue their own 'interest' (sympheron). We cannot act against what we perceive to be our own good. Therefore, genuine altruism in the conventional sense is a psychological impossibility. The conflict arises when we define 'self-interest' as externals (body, wealth, reputation). Since externals are scarce and competitive (zero-sum), my gain is your loss, turning even fathers and sons into enemies (the 'bone' thrown between dogs). The only solution is to redefine 'Self-Interest' by relocating the 'Good' into the Prohairesis (moral character/will). If I identify my 'self' with my capacity for faithfulness and virtue, then sacrificing external goods for a friend becomes a selfish act in the highest sense—because it preserves my own character. Only the Sage (the wise man) can be a true friend because only he has aligned his self-interest with virtue, making his loyalty unshakeable regardless of external circumstances. Friendship based on utility or pleasure is fragile and animalistic; friendship based on shared virtue is invincible.",

    "english": "Everyone reads a book with greater pleasure and ease when it is written in clear characters; likewise, everyone listens more readily to a discourse expressed in becoming and graceful words. However, we must not say that there is no such thing as a faculty of expression. To do so is at once impious and cowardly. Impious, because it dishonors the gifts of God, just as if one were to deny the usefulness of sight or hearing. Has God given you eyes in vain? Has He given you the air and light in vain? Man, do not be ungrateful! Give thanks for sight, for hearing, for life itself, and for the grain and wine that sustain it. But remember, He has given you something superior to all of these: the faculty that uses them, that tests them, that calculates the value of each. For what is it that declares upon the value of sight? Is it the eye itself? No. It is the Faculty of Will—your Moral Purpose (Prohairesis). This faculty takes the others as servants, tests them, and judges them. Does the eye decide when to open or close? No, the Will decides. Does the tongue decide when to speak? No, the Will decides. \n\nWhat, then, is the mistake you are making? It is this: You are like a man traveling to his homeland who passes a magnificent inn. Finding the inn pleasant, he stays there. Man! You have forgotten your purpose! You were not traveling to this place, but through it. Your object was to return to your true country—to relieve your family of fear, to fulfill your duties as a citizen. You did not leave home merely to choose a nice spot to stay! So it is with you here. To perfect your Will and conform to Nature, you must pass through instructions and theories. But because the instruction is pleasant, or the style of the discourse is clever, you stop there. You get stuck in the inn. You are captivated by a turn of phrase or a syllogism, and you rot there. You were meant to make yourself free, unhindered, and faithful, to look upon God's administration without complaint. Instead, you focus on pretty words. I do not say you should neglect the faculty of speech, any more than you should neglect your eyes. But do not look upon it as the Highest Good. For a man may speak like Demosthenes and yet be miserable; but if he rectifies his Will, he is happy.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus establishes the proper hierarchy of human faculties. He acknowledges that skills like rhetoric (the faculty of expression) and logic are valuable tools given by Nature/God, and it is ungrateful to despise them (a swipe at Cynics or those who feigned ignorance). However, he employs the 'Argument of the User': a tool cannot judge itself. The eye sees, but cannot judge if seeing is good at that moment. The only faculty capable of self-reflection and judging the value of other faculties is the 'Prohairesis' (Moral Purpose/Will). \n\nThe core practical lesson is illustrated by the famous 'Analogy of the Inn.' Philosophy and study are a journey toward a destination: a virtuous character in harmony with Nature. Intellectual aesthetics (beautiful writing, complex logic puzzles) are merely 'nice hotels' along the road. The student fails if they become so enamored with the comfort of the classroom or the beauty of the lecture that they never leave to apply the lessons in real life. We must use the tools of speech and logic to aid our progress, not mistake them for the progress itself.",

    "english": "When a certain man, whom I had not judged ready for instruction, said to me, 'I have come to you often, desiring to hear you, yet you have never answered me; now, if possible, I beg you to say something to me,' I replied: Do you think that there is a specific art to speaking, just as there is for other things, which the expert possesses and speaks with skill, while the non-expert speaks without it? He admitted this. Does it not follow that he who speaks with skill benefits himself and is able to benefit others, while he who lacks this skill is harmed and harms others? And would you find that some listeners are benefited while others are harmed? He agreed. Therefore, is there also a skill in hearing, just as there is in speaking? It seems so. Consider it this way: to touch a musical instrument properly belongs to whom? The musician. And to view a statue with the proper understanding belongs to whom? The sculptor. Does it not seem to you that to see with expertise requires a certain art? It does. So, if speaking properly belongs to the expert, do you see that listening with benefit also belongs to the expert? Let us leave aside distinct perfection for the moment, since we are both far from such heights; but this much I think everyone would concede: that he who intends to listen to philosophers needs at least some training in listening. Is this not so? Then what is it you wish to hear from me? Show me. Do you want to hear about good and evil? Good and evil regarding what? A horse? No. An ox? No. A human being? Yes. Do we know, then, what a human being is? What is his nature? What is the concept of him? Are our ears even open to these questions? Do you understand what Nature is, or can you follow me in any degree when I speak? Shall I use demonstrations with you? How? Do you even understand what a demonstration is, or how a thing is demonstrated, or by what means? Do you know what assumes the form of a demonstration but is not one? Do you know what is true or false? What follows from what? What is contradictory, or discordant? But perhaps I should stir you toward philosophy. How can I show you the contradiction of the multitude, how they differ regarding things good, evil, profitable, and unprofitable, when you do not even know what a contradiction is? Show me, then, what I shall accomplish by conversing with you. Arouse in me a desire to speak. Just as suitable grass, when it appears to a sheep, moves it to eat—but if you set a stone or bread before it, it will not be moved—so too there are certain natural impulses in us toward speaking, when a listener appears who is capable of hearing, when he provokes us. But if he sits there like a stone or a tuft of grass, how can he move a man's desire? Does the vine say to the farmer, 'Tend me'? No, its very nature invites care. Trustworthy and sharp-witted children provoke nearly everyone to play with them and crawl with them; but who desires to play with a donkey? For even if it is small, it is still a donkey. Why, then, do you say I have nothing to say to you? I have only this to say: that he who knows not who he is, nor for what purpose he was born, nor in what sort of world he exists, nor with whom he shares it, nor what things are good or bad, noble or base; and who can neither follow a logical argument nor a demonstration, nor distinguish truth from falsehood—such a man will neither desire according to nature nor avoid, nor engage in impulse or design; he will not assent, he will not refuse, he will not suspend judgment. To sum it up: he will go about deaf and blind, thinking himself to be something when he is nothing. Is this a new state of affairs? Is it not arguably the source of all errors and misfortunes since the race of men began? Why did Agamemnon and Achilles quarrel? Was it not through ignorance of what was advantageous and disadvantageous? Did not one say it was better to return Chryseis to her father, and the other that it was not? Did they not forget who they were and for what purpose they had come? 'Let it be, man; what did you come for? To gain mistresses or to fight?' 'To fight.' 'With whom? The Trojans or the Greeks?' You leave your duties as a king because you are rich, handsome, strong, or well-born? You think you are safe? Do you not see how Odysseus and Phoenix, the most formidable speakers of the Greeks, silenced Agamemnon? This is all I have to say to you, and I say even this without enthusiasm. Why? Because you have not provoked me. What do I see in you to stir me, as a spirited horse stirs a horseman? Your body? You treat it disgracefully. Your dress? It is luxurious and effeminate. Your bearing? Your look? Nothing. When you want to hear a philosopher, do not say, 'You say nothing to me'; only show yourself worthy of hearing, and you will find that you will move the speaker to speak.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus addresses the didactic relationship between the Stoic teacher and the student. The central lesson is that education is a dialectic process requiring active capacity from both sides; it is not a passive transfer of information. 1) The Art of Listening: Epictetus establishes that just as speaking is a 'techne' (skill/art), so is listening. Without the prerequisite training in logic, definitions (what is a human?), and the ability to distinguish truth from falsehood, the student is like a 'stone'—incapable of receiving the impression of philosophy. 2) Provoking the Teacher: The sage speaks not for the sake of talking, but is drawn out by the 'physis' (nature) of a receptive student, just as grass draws the sheep. If the student focuses only on externals (body, clothes) and neglects the Ruling Faculty (hegemonikon), they offer no 'handle' for the teacher to grasp. 3) The Source of Tragedy: The reference to the Iliad illustrates that all human conflict stems from a corruption of the judgment regarding 'advantageous' and 'disadvantageous' things. Agamemnon and Achilles had power and strength, but lacked the fundamental dogmas of good and evil, leading to disaster. The practical takeaway: Before asking for advanced wisdom, one must cultivate the disposition to receive it.",

Therefore, the faculty of reason is the indispensable standard by which we judge truth, falsehood, and even the value of the standard itself.",

    "english": "What is the distinctive characteristic of error? Every error involves a contradiction. For since the one who errs does not wish to err, but to do right, it is clear that he is not doing what he wishes. For what does the thief wish to do? That which is to his own advantage. If then stealing is contrary to his advantage, he is doing what he does not wish. Now, every rational soul is by nature offended by contradiction; and so long as a man does not understand that he is involved in contradiction, nothing prevents him from doing contradictory things; but when he has understood it, he must of necessity abandon the contradiction and avoid it, just as bitter necessity compels him to renounce the false when he perceives that it is false; but so long as it does not appear false to him, he assents to it as true. He, then, is powerful in argument, and at the same time acts as an exhorter and refuter, who can show to each individual the contradiction by which he errs, and clearly prove to him that he is not doing what he wishes, and is doing what he does not wish. For if one shows him this, he will withdraw from it of his own accord. But so long as you do not show him, do not wonder if he persists; for it is because he acts under the impression that he is doing right that he does it. That is why Socrates, trusting in this power, used to say, 'I am not in the habit of producing any other witness of what I say, but I am always satisfied with the man who is discussing with me, and I take his vote and call him as a witness, and though he is but one, he suffices in place of all.' For he knew by what the rational soul is moved—that like a balance scale, it must incline.",
    "notes": "This passage outlines the fundamental Stoic epistemological doctrine regarding moral error, often referred to as the Socratic Paradox: 'No one does wrong willingly.' Epictetus teaches that all vice arises from a contradiction in judgment. Every human being desires their own advantage (the Good); however, due to ignorance, they mistake vice (like stealing) for advantage. The moment the rational soul is made aware of this contradiction—that the action it is taking defeats the goal it seeks—it is compelled by nature to reject the error, just as the mind is compelled to reject a falsehood once it is exposed. Therefore, the role of the Stoic teacher is not to punish, but to demonstrate this contradiction ('elenchus') to the student. If the student persists in error, it is proof that the teacher has not yet successfully made the contradiction manifest to them.",

    "english": "Tell me, young man: do you not observe that some dogs are beautiful, and some horses, and so on with all other animals? And are there not beautiful men and ugly men? Do we call them all 'beautiful' by the same standard, or does each have its own specific standard? Look at it this way: what makes a dog beautiful is the presence of a dog's excellence; what makes a horse beautiful is the presence of a horse's excellence. Therefore, what makes a man beautiful? Is it not the presence of human excellence? So, if you wish to be beautiful, you must labor at this: human excellence! \n\nAnd what is that? Look at whom you praise when you judge without emotion. Do you praise the just or the unjust? The temperate or the licentious? The self-controlled or the unrestrained? Then know this: by making yourself just, temperate, and self-controlled, you will make yourself beautiful. But as long as you neglect these things, you will remain ugly, no matter how many tricks you employ to appear beautiful on the outside.\n\nI hardly know how to address the rest. If I speak my mind about your grooming, I will offend you, and you may leave and never return. But if I stay silent, consider how cruel I am being to you. If you came to me for healing, and I looked at you—in such a shameful state—and said nothing, you would rightly blame me later: 'Why did Epictetus see me like this and stay silent? Did he give up on me?' \n\nSocrates did not stay silent; he questioned everyone, asking them to care for their souls. And I? I am the one whose duty it is to care for men. But you ask, 'Who are you to meddle?' I am the one who knows that in every species there is a distinction. In oxen, in dogs, in horses. Do not tell me that a man is no different from a woman! \n\nYoung man, whom do you wish to make beautiful? First, know who you are, and then adorn yourself accordingly! You are a human being; that is, a mortal animal capable of using impressions rationally. What distinguishes you? Not your mortality, nor your flesh. It is your reason! Adorn and beautify that reason; leave your hair to Him who formed it as He willed! \n\nAre you a man or a woman? A man. Then adorn the man, not the woman. Nature made woman smooth and soft; for a man, hair is his natural sign. To pluck and smooth yourself is to turn yourself into a monster, a spectacle to be exhibited in Rome! Are you accusing Nature? 'Why did you make me a man?' Cast away the cause of your hair, make yourself a woman entirely so we are not confused! \n\nWhom do you try to please? Lewd women? Please them as a man! Or do you think you will please them by becoming like them? What sort of citizen are we to make of you? A smooth-skinned governor? A hairless judge? Heaven forbid! \n\nGo away from here, apply these words to yourself, and say: 'It was not Epictetus who told me this, but some benevolent God speaking through him.' For the gods speak through human voices to warn us not to overturn the order of things. You are not flesh and hair; you are a moral will—a prohairesis! If you keep that beautiful, then you are beautiful. Wash your body, yes, but wash it as a man. Let the rooster be a rooster, the lion a lion, and the man a man!",
    "notes": "This discourse centers on the Stoic concept of 'Role Ethics' and 'Living in Accordance with Nature.' Epictetus uses the specific example of a male student engaging in excessive grooming (depilation) to illustrate a deeper philosophical failure. \n\n1. **True Beauty is Moral:** Epictetus argues that beauty is species-specific. For a human, beauty is found in 'human excellence' (arete)—specifically the virtues of justice, temperance, and self-control. Physical adornment is indifferent; moral adornment is essential.\n\n2. **Acceptance of Nature's Design:** The Stoics believed the universe is rationally ordered (Logos). Physical characteristics (like a beard for a man in the ancient context) are signs of one's place in that order. To alter one's body to look like the opposite sex is to rebel against Nature's assignment and to reject one's specific duty as a human male. It is an act of ingratitude toward the Creator.\n\n3. **The Teacher's Duty:** Epictetus highlights the obligation of the philosopher to speak the truth (parrhesia), even when it risks offending the student. Like Socrates or a divine messenger, the teacher must prioritize the student's moral correction over their comfort.\n\n4. **Identity as Will (Prohairesis):** The climax of the lesson is the reminder that the self is not the body ('meat and hair') but the capacity for choice ('prohairesis'). A Stoic must focus all attention on beautifying their character, leaving the body clean but in its natural state.",

    "english": "There are three fields of study in which the man who desires to be good and noble must be trained. The first concerns desires and aversions, ensuring that he may never fail to get what he desires nor fall into what he would avoid. The second concerns the impulse to act and not to act, and, in a word, the sphere of duty; that he may act deliberately, with good reason, and not carelessly. The third concerns freedom from deception and hasty judgment, and, in general, the sphere of assent. Of these, the most important and most urgent is the first: that which concerns the passions. For passion arises only when desire fails or aversion is realized. This is what brings about turmoil, tumult, misfortune, and calamity; this causes sorrows, lamentations, and envies; this makes men envious and jealous, until we are unable to even listen to reason. The second concerns our duties. For I ought not to be unfeeling like a statue, but I should maintain my natural and acquired relations—as a pious man, a son, a brother, a father, and a citizen. The third belongs to those who are already making progress; it concerns the security of the other two, so that not even in sleep, nor drunkenness, nor melancholy may an untested impression pass us by. 'But this,' someone says, 'is beyond us.' Yet the philosophers of today, leaving the first and second fields, devote themselves to the third: to equivocal arguments, syllogisms, and hypothetical puzzles. 'For,' they say, 'we must guard against being deceived.' Who must? The good and noble man. Is this, then, what you lack? Have you mastered the other fields? Are you free from deception regarding money? If you see a beautiful girl, do you resist the impression? If your neighbor receives an inheritance, does it not bite you? At present, do you lack nothing but unshakeable logic? Wretch! Even while you are learning these things, you tremble with fear; you worry that someone might despise you, and you go around asking if anyone is talking about you. And if someone comes and says, 'A discussion arose as to who is the best philosopher, and someone present said, \"Only that man is a true philosopher,\"' your little soul grows from an inch to two cubits. But if another says, 'You are listening to a fool; what does he know? He has the rudiments, but nothing more,' you are beside yourself; you turn pale and cry out, 'I will show him who I am! I am a great philosopher!' These things are seen through your behavior itself; why do you want to show it by other means? Do you not know how Diogenes demonstrated a sophist? He extended his middle finger at him, and when the man went mad with rage, Diogenes said, 'This is the man! I have pointed him out to you.' For a man is not shown like a stone or a piece of wood by a finger; but when one shows a man's judgments, then he has shown the man. Let us look at your judgments, then. Is it not clear that you place your moral purpose in nothing, but look outward to things outside your will? You look for what so-and-so will say, and what you will seem to be—whether a man of learning, or one who has read Chrysippus or Antipater. If you have read Archedemus too, you possess everything! Why are you still in agony lest you fail to show us who you are? Would you like me to tell you what you have shown us? You have shown us a man who walks meanly, complaining, ill-tempered, cowardly, finding fault with everything, blaming everyone, never quiet, always boasting. This is what you have shown us! Go away now and read Archedemus; then, if a mouse falls and makes a noise, you are a dead man. For such a death awaits you as it did—who was it?—Crinis. He too was proud that he understood Archedemus. Wretch! Will you not leave these things alone that do not concern you? These things are suitable for those who can learn them without perturbation; who can say: 'I am not angry, I am not grieved, I am not envious, I am not hindered, I am not compelled.' What is left for me? I have leisure; I am at peace. Let us see how we should deal with logical inversions; let us see how one may accept a hypothesis and not be led into absurdity. It belongs to the well-ordered to tend the fire, to dine if it so happens, to sing and dance; but when the ship is sinking, do you come to me to hoist the topsails?",
    "notes": "This section defines the 'Three Topoi' (Fields of Study), which form the structural curriculum of Epictetus's school. 1. The Discipline of Desire (Orexis): The prerequisite for all philosophy. We must train ourselves to desire only what is within our control and fear only our own moral corruption. Failure here results in 'passion' (pathos)—emotional turmoil that renders reason impossible. 2. The Discipline of Action (Hormē): How to interact with the world. We are not to be unfeeling statues; we have duties (kathēkonta) as citizens and family members that must be performed reasonably and appropriately. 3. The Discipline of Assent (Sunkatathēsis): The advanced study of logic and judgment to ensure our perceptions are true. Epictetus harshly criticizes his students for skipping the first two essential steps to show off their skills in the third. He argues that being an expert in logic (reading Archedemus) is useless if one is still a slave to vanity, fear, and temper. A true philosopher is proven by their character and reaction to insults, not by their ability to solve logical paradoxes.",

    "english": "What is the raw material of the good, and towards what object must our training be directed? The material of the noble and the good is the Ruling Faculty itself; the body is merely raw material for the physician and the physical trainer. Now, just as every soul is designed by nature to nod assent to the truth, to reject the false, and to suspend judgment on the uncertain, so too is it designed to be moved by desire toward the good, by aversion toward the evil, and to remain neutral toward what is neither. Just as the banker or the vegetable seller cannot reject Caesar's coinage—but if you show the coin, willing or not, he must hand over what is sold in exchange—so it is with the soul. When the good appears, it immediately moves the soul toward it; the evil moves the soul away. Never will a soul reject a clear impression of the good, any more than a merchant rejects Caesar's coin. On this mechanism hangs every movement of both God and man. Therefore, the good is preferred over every relationship. 'I have nothing to do with my father, only with the good.' 'Are you so hard?' 'Yes, for this reason: if the good is something different from the noble and the just, then father, brother, country, and all such things vanish.' 'But shall I overlook my own good so that you may have yours, and shall I give way to you?' 'For what return?' 'I am your father.' 'But you are not the Good.' 'I am your brother.' 'But you are not the Good.' However, if we place the good in the correct use of the Will, then the very act of preserving relationships becomes the good; and consequently, the one who gives way in external matters is the one who attains the good. The father takes the money? The brother will have the greater share of the field? Let them! For who can cast you out of your true possession? Not even Zeus, for He did not wish to have that power, but He put it in my own control and gave it as He possessed it Himself: unhindered. When, therefore, one man values one coin and another uses a different one, whoever shows the coin gets what is sold in exchange. A thieving proconsul comes to the province. What coin does he use? Silver. Show it to him and carry off what you want. An adulterer comes. What coin does he use? Little girls. Take the coin and sell me the small item. Another is obsessed with boys. Give him the coin and take what you want. Another loves hunting. Give him a fine horse or a dog; groaning and lamenting, he will sell you what you want in exchange, for another compels him from within—the one who has set the value on this currency. It is against this specific kind of appearance that one must exercise. As soon as you step out at dawn, examine whomever you see, whomever you hear; answer as if under interrogation. What did you see? A beautiful woman or handsome man? Apply the rule: Is it outside the Will or subject to the Will? Outside the Will. Throw it out! What did you see? Someone mourning the death of a child? Apply the rule. Death is outside the Will. Throw it out of the way! Did a consul meet you? Apply the rule. What sort of thing is a consulship? Outside the Will or subject to the Will? Outside the Will. Throw this out too; it does not pass the test; cast it away, it is nothing to you. If we acted this way and practiced this from morning until night, by the Gods, something would come of it! But now, we are immediately caught gaping by every impression, and only in the lecture hall, if even there, do we wake up a little. Then, when we go out and see someone mourning, we say, 'He is ruined! Blessed is the rich man! Wretched is the poor man! He has nothing to eat!' These wicked judgments must be cut out; this is where our effort must be focused. For what is weeping and groaning? A judgment. What is misfortune? A judgment. What is conflict, discord, complaint, accusation, impiety, foolishness? They are all judgments, and nothing else—judgments concerning things outside the Will, assuming them to be good or evil. Let a person transfer these judgments to the realm of the Will, and I guarantee he will be steadfast, whatever his external circumstances. The soul is like a bowl of water; impressions are like the ray of light falling upon the water. When the water is disturbed, the ray seems to move, but it does not move. So, when a man suffers vertigo, it is not the arts and virtues that are confused, but the spirit in which they exist; when that spirit settles, they settle also.",
    "notes": "This discourse centers on the 'Determinism of Assent' and the practical application of the 'Discipline of Assent.' Epictetus uses the analogy of Caesar's coin to demonstrate that humans are universally compelled to pursue what they perceive as the Good. We cannot reject a clear impression of advantage any more than a merchant can refuse legal tender. The root of all vice is not malicious intent, but a corrupted definition of 'the Good.' If a governor values silver (the thief) or lust (the adulterer), that is the currency for which he sells his integrity (his Ruling Faculty). He feels compelled 'from within' by his own erroneous valuation. To counter this, Epictetus prescribes a rigorous, almost military drill: the 'Dawn Patrol.' We must constantly categorize every impression (phantasia) using the fundamental Stoic dichotomy: Is this 'prohairetic' (up to my will/choice) or 'aprohairetic' (external, indifferent)? If it is external (like beauty, death, or office), we must 'throw it out'—meaning we must strip it of moral weight. The final metaphor of the bowl of water offers a profound psychological insight: the virtues (knowledge of how to live) remain objectively intact even during emotional turmoil. The 'light' (virtue) only appears to shake because the 'water' (the spirit or pneuma) is agitated. Calming the spirit allows the stability of virtue to manifest again.",

    "english": "Concerning the man who showed unseemly partisanship in the theater. When the Procurator of Epirus showed unseemly zeal for a certain comedian and was publicly reviled for it, and then reported to me that he had been abused and was indignant at those who did it, I said: Why, what evil were they doing? They were showing zeal, just as you were. And when he said, 'But does anyone show zeal in such a way?', I replied: When they saw you, their governor and the friend of Caesar, showing such zeal, were they not bound to show zeal in the same way? For if it is not right to show zeal in this way, do not do it yourself; but if it is right, why are you angry if they imitated you? For whom else do the many have to imitate but you, their superiors? To whom do they look when they come to the theaters, if not to you? They say, 'Look how Caesar's Procurator behaves! He shouts, so I will shout. He leaps up, so I will leap up. His slaves sit around him shouting; I have no slaves, but as a substitute for them all, I will shout as loud as I can myself.' You ought to know, then, that when you enter the theater, you enter as a rule and example to the others of how they ought to behave. Why, then, did they revile you? Because every man hates that which stands in his way. They wanted such-a-one to be crowned; you wanted another. They stood in your way, and you in theirs. You proved the stronger; they did what they could—they reviled the obstacle. What then would you have? That you should do what you please, but they should not even say what they please? And what is strange in this? Do not farmers revile Zeus when they are hindered by him? Do not sailors revile him? Do they cease reviling Caesar? What then? Does not Zeus know? Is not what is said reported to Caesar? What does he do? He knows that if he punishes all who revile him, he will have no one to rule. What, then, should you have said when you entered the theater? 'Come, let Sophron be crowned'? No. Say rather, 'Come, let me keep my moral purpose in a state according to nature regarding this matter.' No one is dearer to me than myself; it is ridiculous, therefore, for me to be harmed just so that another man may win a prize for comedy. — 'Whom, then, do I wish to win?' — The one who wins; and in this way, the one whom I wish will always win. — 'But I want Sophron to be crowned.' — Then hold as many contests as you please in your own house and proclaim him victor of the Nemean, Pythian, Isthmian, and Olympic games; but in public do not claim more than your share nor snatch away what belongs to the community. Otherwise, endure being abused; for when you do the same things as the mob, you place yourself on a level with them.",
    "notes": "This discourse highlights the Stoic concept of 'Role Ethics' and the discipline of desire. 1. **Leadership as a Canon:** Epictetus admonishes the official for failing his role. A leader is a 'canon' (standard/ruler) against which the public measures themselves. If the ruler lacks self-control (acting like a fanatical sports fan), he validates the mob's lack of self-control. You cannot act like the mob and expect the respect due to a governor. 2. **The Nature of Conflict:** Conflict arises when two parties desire mutually exclusive externals (e.g., 'I want Player A to win' vs. 'You want Player B to win'). Since you cannot both have your way, you become obstacles to one another. The mob, lacking power, uses verbal abuse as their only weapon against the obstacle. 3. **The Invincible Desire:** The central lesson is the redirection of desire. If you desire a specific external outcome (e.g., Sophron winning), you are a slave to fortune and the judges. If you desire that 'the winner shall win,' you align your will with reality (Fate). By desiring only that your own Character (prohairesis) remains harmonious and unperturbed, you become invincible. No one is dearer to you than your own soul; sacrificing your peace of mind for a trivial game is the height of folly.",

    "english": "To those who leave because of illness. 'I am sick here,' he says, 'and I want to go home.' Tell me, were you never sick at home? Do you not consider whether you are doing anything here that contributes to your moral purpose, to set it right? For if you are accomplishing nothing, you came here in vain to begin with. Go away! Attend to your domestic affairs. If your ruling faculty cannot maintain conformity with nature, perhaps your little patch of land can. You will increase your small change, you will nurse your father in his old age, you will frequent the market, you will hold office; being a bad man, you will do whatever comes next badly. But if you are aware of yourself—that you are casting off bad judgments and taking up others in their place, and that you have shifted your station from things outside the will to things within the will—and yet you still say 'Woe is me'? Do you not know that illness and death must overtake us while we are doing something? They overtake the farmer while he is farming, the sailor while he is sailing. What do you wish to be doing when you are overtaken? For you must be overtaken doing something. If you have anything better to be doing than this when you are caught, do it. But for my part, I would wish to be found attending to nothing but my moral purpose—that it may be unperturbed, unhindered, uncompelled, free. I want to be found practicing these things, so that I may be able to say to God: 'Have I transgressed your commands in any way? Have I used the resources you gave me wrongly? Did I use my senses or my preconceptions in vain? Did I ever accuse you? Did I ever find fault with your administration? I fell ill, because you wished it; so did others, but I did so willingly. I became poor because you wished it, but I did so rejoicing. I held no office, because you did not wish it; and I never desired office. Did you ever see me gloomier because of this? Did I not always approach you with a cheerful face, ready for whatever you might order or indicate? Now you wish me to leave the festival; I go, giving you all thanks that you deemed me worthy to take part in this festival with you, to see your works, and to understand your administration.' May death overtake me while I am thinking these things, while I am writing these things, while I am reading these things. 'But,' you say, 'my mother will not hold my head while I am sick.' Go away to your mother, then; for you are exactly the sort of person who deserves to have his head held while he is sick! 'But at home I used to lie on a fine little bed.' Go away to your fine little bed! When you are healthy, are you any better? But what does Socrates say? 'As one man rejoices in improving his land, and another his horse, so I rejoice day by day in observing that I am becoming better.' 'In what way? In little phrases?' Man, hold your tongue! 'In little theorems?' What are you doing? 'And indeed, I do not see what else philosophers busy themselves with.' Does it seem like nothing to you to never accuse anyone, neither God nor man? To never blame anyone? To always carry the same expression on your face, whether going out or coming in? These were the things Socrates knew, and yet he never said that he knew anything or taught anything. But if anyone asked for little phrases or theorems, he took them to Protagoras, or to Hippias. Just as if someone had come looking for vegetables, he would have taken him to the gardener. Who among you, then, has this purpose? For if you did, you would be sick with pleasure, and you would hunger with pleasure, and you would die with pleasure. If any of you has ever been in love with a charming girl, he knows that I speak the truth.",
    "notes": "Epictetus uses this discourse to attack the student's attachment to physical comfort, contrasting the 'amateur' mindset with the rigorous demands of the philosophical life. The core lesson is that geography does not solve internal problems; a man who is 'bad' (lacking wisdom) at school will be 'bad' at home, merely tending to external indifferences like money or family duty without virtue. The centerpiece of the section is the prayer of the ideal Stoic, demonstrating total alignment with the Divine Will (Amor Fati). The philosopher wishes to be 'caught' by death not while seeking comfort, but while tending to their 'prohairesis' (moral choice), ensuring it remains unhindered and free. Epictetus mocks the student's desire for his mother or a soft bed to highlight that true philosophy is not about 'little theorems' or academic study, but about the hard discipline of character—specifically, the ability to face illness, poverty, and death without blaming God or man, maintaining a consistent and cheerful demeanor regardless of circumstance.",

    "english": "Here are some scattered thoughts.\n\nSomeone asked me, 'Why is it that while the study of logic is more labored over now, the progress made in the past was greater?' I replied: In what have we labored now, and in what was the progress greater then? For you will find progress exactly where the labor is invested. Today, men labor to analyze syllogisms, and indeed, progress is made—in analyzing syllogisms! But back then, they labored to maintain the ruling faculty in harmony with nature; consequently, they made progress in character. Therefore, do not confuse the two, nor expect that while you labor at one thing, you will make progress in another. Look closely: is any one of us striving to maintain his mind in accordance with nature? You will find no one. \n\nThe good and serious man is invincible. Why? Because he enters no contest where he is not superior; he competes only for that which depends on his own moral choice. How, then, can he fail to be unconquerable?\n\nWhen asked what 'common sense' is, I answered: Just as a 'common ear' is one capable only of distinguishing vocal sounds—whereas the musical ear distinguishes tones—so there are certain things which men, unless they are utterly perverted, can perceive by the common resources of nature. Such a constitution of the mind is called common sense.\n\nIt is not easy to encourage soft young men; you cannot pick up soft cheese with a hook! But those of a good nature hold on to reason all the more firmly if you try to turn them away. That is why Rufus used to discourage students as a test of their natural disposition. He used to say, 'Just as a stone, even if you throw it upward, will fall down to earth by its own constitution, so too the well-natured student: the more one tries to beat him back, the more he inclines toward that for which he is naturally born.'",
    "notes": "This section covers four distinct, practical Stoic principles. \n\n1. The Law of Specificity in Training: We are often confused why our intellectual study of philosophy does not result in a better life. Epictetus clarifies that if you exercise logic, you get better at logic. If you want a virtuous character (a ruling faculty in agreement with nature), you must exercise your choices and behavior, not just your dialectic skills.\n\n2. The Definition of Invincibility: A Stoic cannot be beaten because they never bet on external outcomes. If your victory condition is 'I will do my best' rather than 'I will win the medal,' you are in total control of your success. The 'contest' is internal.\n\n3. Common Sense (Koinos Nous): This is the baseline sanity required for a human to function. It is the ability to perceive obvious moral and physical realities before philosophy refines them. A person lacking this is 'distorted' or distinct from the human norm.\n\n4. The Test of the True Student: Philosophy is hard. Epictetus compares weak students to 'soft cheese'—if you try to hook them with wisdom, they crumble. A true student has a gravitational pull toward the Good. Musonius Rufus (Epictetus's teacher) used 'reverse psychology' to filter students; if discouragement made them quit, they weren't ready. If it made them fight harder to stay, they were 'well-natured.'",

    "english": "To the Administrator of the Free Cities, who was an Epicurean: When this official came to visit him, Epictetus said: It is appropriate for us laymen to inquire of you philosophers, just as those coming to a strange city ask the citizens what is best there, so that we too may know and observe it. Tell me, what is the best thing in the universe? We generally agree on three categories: the soul, the body, and external things. It is for you to answer which is the best. Shall we say the flesh? Did Maximus sail all the way to Cassiope in winter with his son for the sake of the flesh? No? Then it is not fitting to be zealous about the flesh, but about that which is best. What is better than flesh? The soul. Are the goods of the best part better than the goods of the inferior? Yes. Are the goods of the soul within our power (volitional) or outside it? Within our power. Is the pleasure of the soul, then, a matter of choice? He agreed. But on what does this pleasure depend? If it depends on the good of the soul, then the essence of the Good is found in the soul. But you Epicureans cannot say this, for you claim the Good is in the flesh. If you have any sense, you must admit that soul-pleasure depends on bodily pleasure, which makes the body the primary Good. Therefore, Maximus acted foolishly if he sailed for anything other than his flesh! But consider this: If you could steal secretly, without anyone knowing, would you? Epicurus says the act is not bad, only the detection. If you have powerful friends in Rome and can hide it, why abstain from stealing or adultery? It implies you are foolish to pass up the 'Good' (pleasure). But you do abstain! You are better than your own philosophy; you speak shameful doctrines but do noble deeds. Imagine a city of Epicureans: 'I will not marry.' 'Neither will I.' 'I will not raise children.' The city collapses! These doctrines ruin states and families. You, sir, are a judge in a ruling city. You must judge justly and respect property. Find doctrines consistent with your station! Do not honor the material—the silver—but the craftsmanship. The flesh is merely the raw material; the primary things are the duties of life: citizenship, marriage, worship. We are by nature free, noble, and capable of shame. Make pleasure a servant to these duties, not a master. You say, 'I am rich, I need nothing, I judge the Greeks.' Do you know how to judge? Who taught you? You say, 'Caesar gave me a commission.' Let him give you a commission to judge music; what use is it if you are not a musician? And how did you become a judge? By kissing whose hand? By sleeping at whose door? You can throw a man in prison—so can a stone. You can beat a man—so can a donkey. This is not the rule of men. Rule us as rational beings! Show us our true interests and we will follow. Make us emulate you, as men emulated Socrates. He ruled men by ruling their wills, not their bodies. He said: 'Do this, do not do that, or you will be harmed in your soul.' You say: 'Do this, or I will throw you in prison.' That is the rule of a tyrant over cattle.",
    "notes": "In this lecture, Epictetus exposes the contradiction between the social duties required of a high-ranking official and the self-serving doctrines of Epicureanism. The core lesson is the 'Inconsistency Argument': The official acts with Stoic nobility (refraining from theft, serving as a judge) but holds a philosophy that logically justifies selfishness and social disengagement. Epictetus emphasizes that 'Prohairesis' (moral character/will) is the true governing faculty, not the flesh. He uses the 'Silver Plate' analogy: the metal (body) is less important than the form given to it by the artist (reason/virtue). Finally, he redefines authority: true leadership is not the physical power to imprison bodies (which is brute force), but the pedagogical power to guide the rational wills of others toward the Good.",

    "english": "How ought we to exercise ourselves against impressions? Just as we practice against sophistical puzzles, so we must exercise daily against our impressions, for they too propose questions to us. 'So-and-so’s son has died.' Answer: 'Outside the sphere of choice; not an evil.' 'His father disinherited him.' Answer: 'Outside the sphere of choice; not an evil.' 'He suffered grief.' Answer: 'Within the sphere of choice; an evil.' If we habituate ourselves in this way, we shall make progress; for we will never give our assent to anything except a comprehensive impression. 'The son died.' What happened? The son died. Nothing else? Nothing. 'He has fared badly'—this is something each individual adds from within himself. But if you wish to know how the Romans regard philosophers, listen. Italicus, who was considered the most philosophical among them, once shouted in my presence when he was angry with his own people and felt he was suffering unbearable things: 'I cannot bear it! You are destroying me! You will make me become just like him!'—pointing at me. [To a certain Orator going to Rome for a lawsuit]: When a certain man entered who was going up to Rome for a lawsuit regarding his official rank, I asked him the reason.",
    "notes": "This passage defines the discipline of Assent (synkatathesis). Epictetus treats the philosophical life as an athletic training ground where 'impressions' (phantasiai)—the raw data of our senses—are opponents or puzzles we must solve. The core exercise is the immediate separation of the objective event (the son died) from the subjective value judgment (this is a tragedy). The event is 'aprohaireton' (outside our moral choice/will) and therefore indifferent; only our reaction, which is 'prohairetikos' (within our choice), can be good or evil. The anecdote about Italicus provides a sharp satirical contrast: to a Roman aristocrat, becoming a Stoic—someone who does not rage at their slaves—is seen as a punishment or a loss of power, illustrating how distorted the values of the uneducated world are compared to the philosopher's.",

    "english": "When a certain man entered my school on his way to Rome for a lawsuit regarding his public status, he asked my opinion on his affairs. I replied: If you ask me what will happen to you in Rome—whether you will succeed or fail—I have no theorem for that. But if you ask how you ought to act, I can tell you this: if your judgments are sound, you will act well; if they are corrupt, you will act poorly. For in every case, the cause of action is a judgment. What made you desire to be elected patron of the Cnossians? A judgment. What drives you to Rome now? A judgment. Even through winter storms, danger, and expense? 'It is necessary,' you say. Who told you that? Your judgment.\n\nIf judgments are the causes of all things, then the outcome corresponds to the quality of the cause. Do you and your adversary both have healthy judgments? Impossible, or you would not be in conflict. You think yours are right; he thinks his are. So do madmen. Mere opinion is a rotten criterion. Show me, rather, that you have ever undertaken an audit or care of your own judgments. You sail to Rome for prestige; when did you ever sail to inspect your own principles and cast out the bad ones? As a boy? No. As a youth studying rhetoric? You thought you lacked nothing. As a politician? You would have been offended if anyone questioned your wisdom.\n\nNow you say: 'Help me with my lawsuit.' I have no tools for that. You have come to me as if to a vegetable seller or a cobbler, not a philosopher. What do philosophers have tools for? For this: that whatever the outcome, the ruling faculty remains in accord with nature. Does this seem small to you? It is the greatest thing. It cannot be grabbed in passing while your ship waits in the harbor. You say, 'I met Epictetus.' No, you saw a statue. To truly meet a philosopher, we must compare judgments. Show me yours, let me show you mine; let us refute one another. That is a meeting.\n\nBut you say, 'I have no silver cups, no fine cattle, no estate.' I reply: I have no need of them. But you, even if you acquire many, will still need others. You are poorer than I. I possess what you lack: stability, a mind in harmony with nature, freedom from terror. I do not care what Caesar thinks of me; I flatter no one. These are my gold and silver. You have golden vessels, but your reason, your judgments, your assents, and your impulses are made of cheap clay. You are distracted; I am at leisure to refine my mind. You collect crystal vases; I master the 'Liar' paradox. Your desire is insatiable; mine is full.\n\nConsider the children who put their hand into a narrow-necked jar to grab nuts and figs. If they fill their hand, they cannot pull it out, and then they cry. Drop a few, and you will get the rest out. You, too: let go of your desire. Do not covet many things, and you will obtain what you need.",
    "notes": "This discourse highlights the Stoic distinction between external outcomes and internal character. Epictetus refuses to act as a consultant for the student's legal or political ambitions ('I have no theorem for that'), because those matters fall outside the realm of moral purpose (prohairesis). The core lesson is that our 'judgments' (dogmata) are the sole cause of our actions and our distress. We endure physical hardships (winter storms, expense) for the sake of ambition because of a faulty judgment that prestige is a 'good.' Epictetus contrasts material wealth with spiritual wealth; the politician has golden cups but a mind of 'earthenware' (fragile, cheap clay), while the philosopher has no property but possesses a mind of gold (stable, free from anxiety). The famous metaphor of the child and the narrow-necked jar illustrates the trap of greed (pleonexia): we become trapped not by the external world, but by the volume of our own desires. To be free, one must unclench the fist of desire.",

    "english": "How ought we to bear sickness? Whenever the need for a specific judgment arises, you must have it ready at hand: at a meal, judgments concerning the meal; in the bath, judgments concerning the bath; in bed, judgments concerning the bed. Do not simply memorize verses to shout them out like a hymn to Apollo, but to use them practically. Again, when in a fever, have the judgments ready for that situation. Do not, just because we have a fever, let go of everything and forget our principles, saying, 'If I ever recover, then I will philosophize; but now, let whatever happens, happen.' No! God says to you: 'Give me proof if you have competed lawfully, if you have followed the diet, if you have trained, if you have listened to the trainer.' You say, 'But I am not reading my books!' For what purpose do you read, you slave? Is it not to live smoothly? To be stable? To have your ruling faculty in accordance with nature? What prevents a feverish man from keeping his ruling faculty in accordance with nature? Here is the test of the matter, the proving ground of the philosopher. For this, too, is a part of life—just as walking, just as sailing, just as traveling—so is having a fever. Do you read while you are walking? No. So neither do you read while you have a fever. But if you walk well, you possess the virtue of the walker; if you bear a fever well, you possess the virtue of the fever-sufferer. What is it to bear a fever well? It is not to blame God, not to blame man, not to be crushed by what happens, to await death well and nobly, and to do what is prescribed. When the doctor enters, do not fear what he might say; nor if he says 'You are doing well,' rejoice excessively; nor if he says 'You are doing poorly,' be despondent. Why do you flatter the physician? Why do you say, 'If you wish it, sir, I shall be well'? These are not the works of a philosopher. Where, then, is there still time for fear? Where for anger? Where for fear about externals, about things worth nothing? You must have these two principles ready at hand: that outside the sphere of choice there is nothing either good or bad, and that we must not try to lead events, but follow them. Do not say: 'My brother ought not to have treated me this way.' That is his business; yours is to handle it. No one can hinder your will; external things are hindered.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus addresses the common failure of students who treat philosophy as an academic exercise (reading books) rather than a lived practice. The core lesson is that illness is not an interruption of one's philosophical work, but rather a specific 'test' (elenchos) or 'arena' in which to demonstrate it. Just as there is a proper way to walk, there is a proper way to be sick ('kalos pyressein'). \n\nKey Stoic takeaways include:\n1. **The Separation of Domains:** The body belongs to the external world (and the doctor), but the 'Ruling Faculty' (hegemonikon) remains yours. A fever can hinder the body, but it cannot hinder the will (prohairesis) unless you allow it.\n2. **The Definition of 'Doing Well':** Success in sickness is not necessarily recovering (which is not entirely up to us); success is enduring the illness without complaining against God or man, without fear of death, and without surrendering one's dignity to the doctor through flattery or anxiety.\n3. **Practical Readiness:** Philosophy consists of having judgments (dogmata) ready for specific situations. When sick, the relevant judgment is that illness is an 'indifferent'—it is neither morally good nor bad, and therefore nothing to fear.",

    "english": "Here are some scattered observations. There are certain punishments established as if by law for those who disobey the divine administration. Whoever judges anything to be good other than what lies within the sphere of moral choice: let him envy, let him desire, let him flatter, let him be disturbed. Whoever judges anything else to be evil: let him grieve, let him mourn, let him lament, let him be wretched. And yet, though we are punished so bitterly, we cannot desist. Remember what the poet says about the stranger: 'It is not lawful for me, even if a worse man than you should come, to dishonor a stranger; for all are from Zeus.' Therefore, have this ready at hand regarding a father as well: 'It is not lawful for me to dishonor a father, even if a worse one than you should come; for all are under the protection of Zeus the Father.' And regarding a brother: 'For all are under the protection of Zeus the God of Kindred.' And in this way, across all other relationships, we shall find Zeus to be the overseer.",
    "notes": "Epictetus frames psychological suffering (envy, grief, anxiety) not as random misfortunes, but as the inevitable, lawful penalties for disobeying the laws of nature—specifically, for valuing externals over one's own reasoned choice (prohairesis). If you value what is not yours, you will be disturbed; that is the price. He then connects this to social duties using Homeric wisdom. We must treat others (strangers, fathers, brothers) according to the sanctity of the role itself, which is divinely overseen by Zeus. A Stoic fulfills their duty to a father or brother regardless of that person's character ('even if a worse one should come') because the obligation arises from the divine order of relationships, not the merit of the individual.",

    "english": "On Training. \n\nWe must not organize our training around unnatural or eccentric feats; otherwise, we who claim to practice philosophy will differ in no way from jugglers. For it is indeed difficult to walk on a tightrope, and not only difficult, but dangerous. Must we, for that reason, practice walking on a tightrope, or setting up palm trees, or embracing statues? By no means. Not everything that is difficult and dangerous is suitable for training, but only that which contributes to the goal of our effort.\n\nAnd what is the goal of our effort? To live without hindrance in our desires and our aversions. And what is that? Neither to fail in getting what we desire nor to fall into what we avoid. Our training must therefore focus on this. Since it is impossible to possess desire that never fails and aversion that never stumbles without great and constant practice, know this: if you allow your training to turn outward toward things not within your moral choice, you will have neither successful desire nor safe aversion.\n\nBecause habit is a powerful force leading us, and we are accustomed to using desire and aversion only for external things, we must oppose this habit with a contrary habit; where the slippery slope of impressions is steepest, there we must set up our training. I am inclined toward pleasure; I will lean to the opposite side, beyond the measure, for the sake of training. I am inclined to avoid hard work; I will train and exercise my impressions against this, so that my aversion ceases to shrink from such things.\n\nFor who is the true athlete? The one who practices not using desire at all [for the present], and using aversion only for things within the sphere of moral choice. See how one man trains for one thing, another for another. So what good does it do to set up a palm tree, or to carry about a leather tent and a mortar and pestle? Man, train yourself—if you are arrogant—to endure being reviled, and not to be vexed when dishonored. Then, and only then, consider 'embracing a statue.'\n\nTrain also in the matter of wine—not to drink heavily (for in this, even the clumsy are 'trained'), but first to abstain. Abstain from the pretty girl and the sweet cake. Then, at some later time, you may descend into the arena for the sake of testing—if the time is right—to know yourself, to see if impressions still defeat you as they did before. But at first, flee far away from the stronger temptations. The unequal battle between a pretty girl and a young beginner in philosophy is like a clay pot crashing against a rock.\n\nAfter the discipline of desire and aversion comes the second field of study regarding impulse and duty, and the third concerning assents. Just as Socrates said one must not live an unexamined life, so we must not accept an unexamined impression, but say: 'Wait, let me see who you are and where you come from; show me your credentials. Do you have the stamp of nature which a valid impression must have?'\n\nFinally, regarding physical training: if it tends toward the discipline of desire and aversion, it acts as training. But if it is for display, it belongs to one who has turned outward, hunting for something else, seeking spectators to say, 'Oh, what a great man!' Therefore, Apollonius spoke well: 'When you wish to train yourself, take a mouthful of cold water when you are thirsty in the heat, spit it out, and tell no one.'",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus redefines 'askesis' (training/exercise). He critiques the performative asceticism common among Cynics of his time (carrying heavy loads, embracing cold statues, walking tightropes) as mere vanity if it does not serve the ruling faculty (prohairesis). \n\nKey takeaways:\n1. **The Goal of Training:** The purpose is not physical endurance for its own sake, but the total freedom of the will—specifically, regulating 'orexis' (desire) and 'ekklisis' (aversion) so we never desire the unattainable nor fear the inevitable.\n2. **The Bent Stick Method:** To cure a vice, one must overcorrect. If you are addicted to pleasure, you must temporarily abstain completely (lean 'beyond the measure') to eventually find the balanced mean.\n3. **Pot against Rock:** A novice philosopher is fragile. One must flee strong temptations (like sexual attraction) rather than testing oneself prematurely. Only the advanced student can interact with temptations without yielding.\n4. **Silence is Strength:** The closing quote from Apollonius emphasizes that true Stoic training is internal. If you do something difficult (like denying yourself water in the heat) and then brag about it, you have merely traded physical desire for the desire for social validation (fame), failing to free yourself from externals.",

    "english": "What is solitude, and who is the solitary man? Solitude is a state of helplessness. For a man is not solitary simply because he is alone, just as a man is not necessarily 'not solitary' simply because he is among a crowd. When we lose a brother, a son, or a friend upon whom we relied, we say we have been left desolate, even though we may be in Rome, surrounded by a vast throng and attended by many slaves. For the concept of the solitary man implies one who is helpless and exposed to those who wish to harm him. Therefore, we call ourselves 'solitary' most of all when traveling, if we fall among robbers. For it is not the mere sight of a human being that removes solitude, but the sight of one who is faithful, modest, and helpful. If being alone were enough to make one solitary, you would have to say that Zeus himself, at the Conflagration when he destroys the universe, is solitary and wails, 'Woe is me! I have neither Hera, nor Athena, nor Apollo, nor brother, nor son, nor kin!' Yet some say this is exactly what he does. They do not understand the life of a solitary man; they start from a natural instinct for society and affection. But a man must prepare himself for this too: to be able to suffice unto himself, to be able to keep company with himself. Just as Zeus converses with himself, rests in himself, and contemplates his own administration, so too must we be able to talk to ourselves, not needing others, nor being at a loss for how to pass the time. We must reflect on the divine administration and our relationship to all things. Ask yourself: How did I used to react to events? How do I react now? What things still distress me? How can they be cured? Look, Caesar seems to provide us with a great peace; there are no longer wars or battles or bands of robbers; we can travel by land or sea at any hour. But can Caesar give us peace from fever? From shipwreck? From fire, earthquake, or lightning? Can he give us peace from love? From grief? From envy? No, not from a single one of these. But the reasoning of the philosophers promises to give us peace even from these. And what does it say? 'If you pay attention to me, O men, wherever you are and whatever you do, you will feel no pain, no anger, no compulsion, no hindrance, but you will live untroubled and free from all things.' If a man has this peace, can any evil happen to him? To me, there is no robber, no earthquake; all things are full of peace, full of tranquility. But if God does not provide the necessities? Then He gives the signal of recall; He has opened the door and says to you, 'Come.' Where? To nothing terrible, but to the place from which you came: to the elements. There is no Hades or Acheron, but all things are full of gods and spirits. If one has these thoughts, looking at the sun, the moon, and the stars, enjoying the earth and the sea, he is no more solitary than he is helpless. Why then do we make ourselves worse than little children? When they are left alone, they pick up potsherds and dust and build something, then knock it down and build again; they are never at a loss for amusement. Shall I then, if you sail away, sit and weep because I am left alone? Do I not have potsherds? Do I not have dust? But they do it out of folly; shall we be miserable out of wisdom? Do not strive to show off your philosophy to others. You want to help them? Show them by your own example. Help them by eating correctly, by drinking correctly, by yielding, by enduring. Help them in this way, and do not vomit your own phlegm upon them. As Apollonius used to say: 'When you want to train yourself, grasp a chunk of ice when you are thirsty in the heat, hold it, spit it out, and tell no one.' Just as bad actors cannot sing alone but only in a chorus, so some men cannot walk alone. Man, if you are anything, learn to walk alone!",
    "notes": "This discourse centers on the definition of 'Eremia' (solitude/desolation). Epictetus redefines solitude not as a physical state of isolation, but as a psychological state of helplessness and dependency. The true Stoic aims for 'Autarkeia' (self-sufficiency). The text contrasts the 'Pax Romana' (political peace provided by Caesar, which controls external threats like war and piracy) with the 'Pax Stoica' (inner peace provided by philosophy, which controls internal threats like grief, envy, and fear). The lesson culminates in the metaphor of the 'Open Door': if external circumstances deny you the necessities of life, it is simply Nature signaling that the play is over, and you may depart life without fear, returning your elements to the universe. The teacher admonishes the student to find contentment within their own rational mind (the Hegemonikon) just as Zeus is content within himself, rather than behaving like a dependent child or a bad actor who needs a supporting chorus to function.",

    "english": "Here are some scattered thoughts. Just as bad actors in a tragedy cannot sing a solo but only function within the chorus, so some of you are unable to walk alone. Man, if you are anybody at all, walk alone! Converse with yourself and stop hiding in the choir. Learn to bear ridicule, look around you, and shake yourself up so that you may know who you really are. When someone drinks only water or performs some other ascetic exercise, he seizes every opportunity to announce it to the world, saying, 'I drink water!' If it benefits you to do so, then drink it, but stay silent about it. Or do you wish to please the very people you find annoying? We must excise two things from the human character: arrogance and distrust. Arrogance is the opinion that one lacks nothing; distrust is the assumption that one cannot find happiness amidst adverse circumstances. Refutation removes arrogance—this was the primary work of Socrates. As for whether a good life is possible, look and search; this inquiry will not harm you. Indeed, philosophy is virtually this: seeking how to exercise desire and aversion without hindrance. Someone says to me, 'I am better than you, for my father is a consul,' or 'I have been a tribune, and you have not.' If we were horses, would you say, 'My father was faster,' or 'I have plenty of barley and fine trappings'? If so, I would say, 'Very well, let us run a race!' Come now, is there nothing in a human equivalent to speed in a horse, by which the superior and inferior are distinguished? Is there not modesty, fidelity, and justice? Show yourself superior in these things, so that you may be superior as a human being. If you tell me, 'I can kick very hard,' then you are priding yourself on the talent of a donkey.",
    "notes": "This collection of exhortations focuses on self-sufficiency and the proper metrics of human value. Epictetus uses the 'chorus' metaphor to criticize those who depend on the crowd for identity; a philosopher must have the strength to stand alone and examine their own impressions without needing external validation. He warns against spiritual pride: performing ascetic acts (like teetotalism) for the sake of an audience ruins the purpose of the discipline, turning it into a performance rather than a training of the will. The text identifies two intellectual vices to be removed: 'arrogance' (thinking we already know how to live) and 'distrust' (believing that happiness is impossible in our current situation). Finally, Epictetus dismantles social elitism. He argues that just as a horse is judged by its specific excellence (running) rather than its equipment, a human must be judged by human excellence—virtue, honor, and justice—rather than external accidents like parental status, political rank, or brute physical strength.",

    "english": "In every undertaking, consider what precedes it and what follows it, and only then proceed to the action itself. If you do not, you will begin with enthusiasm because you have not reflected on the consequences, but later, when difficulties appear, you will give up in shame. You say, 'I want to win at the Olympics.' But examine what comes before and what follows, and only then commit to the undertaking. You must submit to discipline, follow a strict diet, abstain from sweet cakes, train under compulsion at a fixed hour in heat or cold, and drink no cold water or wine whenever you please. In short, you must hand yourself over to your trainer as you would to a physician. Then, in the contest, you must gouge and be gouged, occasionally dislocate your wrist, twist your ankle, swallow quantities of sand, be whipped, and after all that, often be defeated. Weigh all this; and if you still wish to do so, go and be an athlete. If you do not, you will be acting like children who play at being wrestlers, then gladiators, then blow trumpets, and then act out tragedies when they see and admire them. So you too are now an athlete, now a gladiator, then a philosopher, then a rhetorician; but with your whole soul, you are nothing. Like a monkey, you mimic whatever you see, and you are always charmed by one thing after another, but soon grow tired of what is familiar. For you did not approach the matter with consideration, nor did you examine it strictly, but you acted randomly and on a cold desire. Thus, some people, when they see a philosopher and hear someone speaking like Euphrates—though who can speak like him?—want to be philosophers themselves. Man, consider first what the matter is, and then examine your own nature to see if you can bear the burden. If you want to be a wrestler, look at your shoulders, your thighs, your loins; for different men are naturally fitted for different things. Do you think that by doing what you do now, you can be a philosopher? Do you think you can eat as you do, drink as you do, and give way to anger and discontent just the same? You must keep watch, labor, conquer certain desires, separate yourself from your kin, be despised by a slave, be laughed at by those you meet, and get the worst of it in everything—in honor, in office, in court. Look these things over carefully and see if you are willing to exchange them for freedom from passion, liberty, and tranquility. If not, do not approach; do not act like the children, being now a philosopher, later a tax collector, then a rhetorician, then a procurator of Caesar. These things do not agree. You must be one person, either good or bad. You must either labor to improve your own ruling faculty or labor for external things; you must work on what is within or what is without. That is to say, you must take the standing either of a philosopher or of a layperson.",
    "notes": "This discourse is a stern warning against dilettantism in philosophy. Epictetus uses the metaphor of the Olympic athlete to illustrate that the path to virtue constitutes a rigorous profession (askesis) requiring total commitment. Just as an athlete sacrifices bodily comforts for victory, a Stoic must sacrifice external advantages (reputation, comfort, social status) to achieve the internal victories of apatheia (freedom from passion) and ataraxia (tranquility). The core lesson is the necessity of internal consistency: one cannot divide their loyalty between the ruling faculty (hegemonikon) and external materials. You must choose to be 'one person'—integrated and whole—rather than a fragmented soul mimicking the roles of others without understanding the cost.",

    "english": "One must be cautious when entering into social relations. It is inevitable that when you associate with certain people—whether in conversation, at banquets, or simply in daily living—you will either assimilate to them, or you will convert them to your own way of living. Consider a dead coal placed next to a burning one: either the dead coal will be kindled by the other, or the burning one will be suffocated by the dead one. Given that the danger is so great, you must be cautious when mixing with the laypeople, remembering that it is impossible to rub against someone covered in soot without getting soot on yourself. \n\nWhat will you do when the conversation turns to gladiators? When someone says, 'This one is bad, that one is good,' or 'This was done well, that poorly'? do you possess the preparation of a musician who, upon taking up a lyre, knows immediately which strings are out of tune and adjusts the instrument? Do you have the power that Socrates had, to lead those he associated with to his own point of view in every conversation? Where would you get such power? No, you will inevitably be dragged around by the laypeople. \n\nWhy are they stronger than you? Because they speak from deep-seated convictions about these rotten things, whereas you speak of elegant truths only from the lips. That is why your words are weak and dead; it makes one sick to hear your exhortations and your miserable 'virtue' that you babble about up and down. Thus, the laypeople conquer you. For everywhere, conviction is strong; conviction is invincible. \n\nTherefore, until your fine principles have hardened within you and you have acquired some power for your own security, I advise you to be cautious in descending into the arena of the laypeople. Otherwise, anything you write down in the school will melt away day by day like wax in the sun. Go far away from the sun as long as your principles are made of wax! This is why philosophers advise us to leave our homelands; because old habits distract us and do not allow the beginning of a new custom to take hold. Just as doctors send the chronically ill to a different country and a different climate—and they do well to do so—you must introduce other habits. Fix your judgments; exercise yourself in them. \n\nBut no! You go from here to the show, to the gladiators, to the gymnasium, to the circus; then back here from there, and back there again—always the same people! You have no fine habit, no attention, no turning toward yourself and observing: 'How am I dealing with the impressions that strike me? In accordance with nature or contrary to it? How do I answer them? As I should, or as I should not? Do I say to things outside my will that they are nothing to me?' If you are not yet in this state, flee your former habits! Flee the laypeople, if you ever wish to begin to be someone.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus addresses the concept of social contagion and the vulnerability of the 'prokoptōn' (the student making progress). The central metaphor is that of coal: character and conviction are transfers of energy. The 'idiōtai' (laypeople/non-philosophers) possess 'rotten' views regarding external goods (like fame, entertainment, or gladiator matches), but they hold these views with the strength of genuine conviction (dogma). The student, conversely, often holds correct philosophical views only superficially ('from the lips'). When these two forces meet, the stronger conviction wins. Therefore, the beginner risks 'melting like wax'—losing their philosophical principles—when exposed to the heat of the crowd's ignorant enthusiasm. The practical Stoic command is strategic isolation: one must flee old environments and habits to allow new, rational judgments to harden. Only the sage (like Socrates) is strong enough to interact with the mob without being polluted; the student must prioritize the protection of their ruling faculty (hegemonikon) until it is invincible.",

    "english": "On Providence. Whenever you make an accusation against Providence, turn your attention inward and examine the circumstances, and you will understand that what has happened is in accordance with reason. You say, 'Yes, but that unjust man has more than I do.' More of what? Look closely: Does he have more faithfulness than you? Does he have more honor? You will not find that to be true. Rather, in the specific area where he is superior to you, there you will find he has the advantage. I once asked a man who was furious about the good fortune of Philostorgus, 'Would you be willing to sleep with Sura to get what he has?' He replied, 'May that day never come!' Why then are you angry if he receives the payment for which he sold himself? How can you call a man happy for possessing things acquired by means you detest? or what wrong does Providence do if it gives the better gifts to the better men? Is it not better to be a person of honor than a rich man? You agree. Why then are you angry, you poor wretch, when you possess the superior portion? Therefore, always remember and keep this rule ready at hand: it is a law of nature that the superior man has more than the inferior in that specific area where he excels. If you do this, you will never be indignant. You say, 'But my wife treats me badly.' She treats you badly—is there anything else to add? Nothing. 'My father gives me nothing.' The fact is he gives you nothing. Therefore, it is not poverty that we must cast out, but our judgment concerning poverty; and then we shall live smoothly.",
    "notes": "This discourse addresses the student's sense of injustice regarding the prosperity of the wicked. Epictetus establishes a 'spiritual economy' based on the Law of Nature: one receives exactly what one pays for. The unjust man pays with his dignity and integrity to purchase wealth and influence; the Stoic pays with his external ambition to purchase fidelity, modesty, and peace of mind. To be jealous of the unjust man's wealth while unwilling to perform the shameful acts required to obtain it is illogical—it is desiring the reward without paying the price. Providence is vindicated because it distributes the 'better' things (virtues) to the 'better' people (those who value character). The final section reiterates the core dichotomy of control: external events (a wife's behavior, a father's stinginess) are objective facts, but suffering arises only from the internal judgment that these facts are 'bad' or 'unbearable.'",

    "english": "On the principle that we ought not to be disturbed by any news. Whenever any disturbing news is brought to you, have this thought ready at hand: news never concerns the sphere of your moral purpose. For can anyone announce to you that you have made a bad assumption or formed a wrong desire? By no means. Instead, they report that someone has died. What is that to you? That someone speaks ill of you. What is that to you? That your father is planning certain measures. Against whom? Against your moral will? How can he? No, his actions are against your poor body, against your little property. You are safe; it is not against 'you'. Therefore, if there is a duty belonging to your father which he fails to fulfill, he has destroyed the father, the affectionate and gentle man, within himself. Seek for him to lose nothing else on this account. But, on your side, it is your specific duty to make your defense with constancy, modesty, and without anger. If you fail to do so, you too have destroyed the son, the modest man, the noble man. What then? Is the judge free from danger? No, he faces an equal risk. Why then do you still fear what judgment he will pass? What have you to do with another man's evil? Your own evil is to make a bad defense; guard against this alone. Whether you are condemned or not is the business of another, and consequently, it is another's evil. 'So-and-so threatens you.' 'He censures you.' 'He is about to condemn you unjustly.'",
    "notes": "Epictetus here provides a psychological shield against 'breaking news' or gossip. The core argument relies on the separation of the *prohairesis* (moral choice) from externals. Information from the outside world can only report on things indifferent (health, reputation, finances), never on the state of one's own soul, which is the only true good or evil. The passage also highlights Stoic Role Ethics: if a father or judge acts unjustly, *they* are the ones damaged because they destroy their own character (the internal 'father' or 'just man'). The student is warned not to mirror this destruction; if the student reacts with anger or fear, they destroy their own character as a 'noble son.' The verdict belongs to the judge and is his potential evil; the defense belongs to the student and is their potential good.",

The primary difference is this: The layperson says, 'Woe is me because of my child, because of my brother, woe because of my father!' The philosopher, if he ever says 'Woe,' stops and says, 'It is because of myself.' If we incline toward this principle—so that whenever we are obstructed, we blame ourselves and remember that nothing else is the cause of disturbance or instability except a judgment—I swear to you by all the gods that we have made progress! But as it is, we have traveled a different path right from the beginning. While we were still children, if we ever stumbled while gaping about, the nurse did not scold us, but beat the stone! For what did the stone do? Did it need to move out of the way just because of your child's foolishness? Again, if we find nothing to eat after coming back from the bath, the tutor never curbs our desire, but beats the cook. You there! Did we appoint you as the cook's tutor? No, but of our child! Correct the child; help the child! Consequently, even when grown up, we appear as children. For in the realm of music, the unmusical man is a child; in the realm of grammar, the unlettered man is a child.",
    "notes": "Epictetus defines the transition from a 'layperson' (idiotes) to a philosopher as a shift in the locus of blame. The non-philosopher externalizes the cause of their suffering, believing that other people or objects constitute their misfortune (e.g., 'Woe is me because of my child'). The philosopher realizes that suffering stems solely from internal judgments (dogma). Epictetus uses the metaphor of the nurse and the stone to illustrate how society conditions us to remain 'children.' By blaming the stone when we trip, or the cook when we are hungry, we are taught that the world must conform to our desires, rather than learning to adapt our desires to the world. True maturity is not a matter of age, but of education in the art of living; without this training, an adult is as helpless and ignorant in handling life's impressions as a child is in handling a musical instrument.",

    "english": "It is a fact that one can derive advantage from all external things. Consider your theoretical exercises: almost everyone agrees that good and evil lie within our own judgment, not in the external materials. No one says that 'it is day' is good, or 'it is night' is bad. What then? Knowledge is good, and error is bad. Therefore, even in falsehood, there is a good to be found: the knowledge that it is false. You ought to apply this same logic to life. Is health a good? Is sickness an evil? No, man! What then? To use health well is good; to use it badly is bad. 'So, is it possible to be benefited by sickness?' you ask. By God, is it not possible to be benefited by death? Do you think Menoeceus gained but little by dying? Stop admiring material things, by the gods! Stop making yourselves slaves first to objects, and then, on their account, to the men who have the power to give or take them away. 'Can I really benefit from these things?' From all of them. 'Even from a person who abuses me?' Tell me, does a sparring partner benefit the athlete? Enormously. He becomes my trainer; he exercises my patience, my freedom from anger, my gentleness. Is your neighbor bad? Bad for himself, perhaps, but for me, he is good; he exercises my fairness and tolerance. Is your father bad? Bad for himself, but for me, good. This is the true wand of Hermes: 'Touch what you will, and it will turn to gold.' No, rather say: Bring me whatever you will, and I will turn it into a good. Bring sickness, bring death, bring poverty, bring abuse, bring a trial for my life—all these I will make blessed, happy, dignified, and enviable through the power of right judgment. But as it stands, you act like this only in the lecture hall. You do not carry it home. The moment you leave, you are at war with your little slave, with your neighbors, with those who mock you. Good luck to Lesbius, for he proves to me every day that I know nothing!",
    "notes": "In this passage, Epictetus teaches the practical application of the 'discipline of assent' regarding external impressions. He emphasizes that external events (health, sickness, death, other people) are 'indifferents' (adiaphora)—neither good nor bad in themselves. Moral value is found strictly in the 'use' one makes of them. He employs the metaphor of the athlete's sparring partner to reframe difficult people not as misfortunes, but as necessary equipment for training virtue (patience, gentleness, fairness). The 'Wand of Hermes' serves as a metaphor for the Stoic prohairesis (moral character), which has the alchemical power to transmute any circumstance—no matter how harsh—into a 'good' by responding to it with virtue. The final rebuke highlights the gap between theoretical understanding in the classroom and practical application in daily life.",

    "english": "To those of you who so casually set out to become lecturers: You gulp down theoretical principles and immediately want to vomit them back up, just as men with weak stomachs do with their food. Digest your learning first! If you do not, it remains vomit—filthy and unfit to eat. But if you digest it properly, show us a change in your Ruling Faculty, just as athletes show their shoulders developed from exercise and diet, or as craftsmen show the results of their training. The carpenter does not come and say, 'Hear me lecture on the art of carpentry,' but rather he builds a house and shows it. You must do the same: eat like a human being, drink like a human being, dress, marry, produce children, and take part in civic life properly. Bear with abuse; endure a difficult brother, father, son, or neighbor. Show us these things so we can see that you have truly learned something from the philosophers. But no! You say, 'Come and listen to me read my commentaries! I will explain the doctrines of Chrysippus like no one else; I will analyze the text flawlessly!' Is this why young men leave their homelands and parents? To come and hear you explain mere words? Should they not rather return home tolerant, cooperative, free from passion, and undisturbed, possessing provision for life that allows them to bear whatever happens with dignity? How can you give them what you do not possess yourself? You are mimicking the Mysteries. You say, 'There is a shrine at Eleusis, so let there be one here. There are torches there, so let there be torches here.' You have the words, but you lack the timing, the purification, and the sanctity. You have opened a doctor's office possessing nothing but drugs, yet you do not know where or how to apply them. Why do you gamble with the greatest matters? Leave this task to those who are capable and divinely appointed. Do not bring shame upon philosophy yourself. If you enjoy the theorems, sit and turn them over in your own mind, but never call yourself a philosopher. Admit that your desires, aversions, and judgments remain exactly as they were before. Stick to that, for that is all you are fit for.",
    "notes": "In this diatribe, Epictetus attacks the 'ostentatious academic'—the person who memorizes Stoic logic and physics but fails to apply Ethics to their own life. The central metaphor is 'digestion': knowledge that is merely memorized and repeated is like undigested food (vomit), whereas true philosophy must be metabolized by the soul to create spiritual muscle (character). Epictetus insists that the proof of philosophy is not found in the ability to explain obscure texts of Chrysippus, but in the successful performance of social roles (father, citizen, neighbor) and the endurance of hardship. He treats the role of a philosophical teacher as a sacred office, comparable to a priest at the Eleusinian Mysteries or a physician; to undertake this cure of souls without having cured oneself is not just foolish, it is an act of impiety and malpractice.",

ἡ κτῆσις; οὐκ ἔχει. τὸ σῶμα; οὐκ ἔχει. ἀλλὰ πολύχρυσος εἶ καὶ πολύχαλκος· τί οὖν σοι κακόν ἐστιν; ἐκεῖνο, ὅ τι ποτὲ ἠμέληταί σου καὶ κατέφθαρται, ᾧ ὀρεγόμεθα, ᾧ ἐκκλίνομεν, ᾧ ὁρμῶμεν καὶ ἀφορμῶμεν. πῶς ἠμέληται; ἀγνοεῖ τὴν οὐσίαν τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ πρὸς ἣν πέφυκε καὶ τὴν τοῦ κακοῦ καὶ τί ἴδιον ἔχει καὶ τί ἀλλότριον. καὶ ὅταν τι τῶν ἀλλοτρίων κακῶς ἔχῃ, λέγει οὐαί μοι, οἱ γὰρ Ἕλληνες κινδυνεύουσι. ταλαίπωρον ἡγεμονικὸν καὶ μόνον ἀτημέλητον καὶ ἀθεράπευτον. μέλλουσιν ἀποθνῄσκειν ὑπὸ τῶν Τρώων ἀναιρεθέντες. ναί, ἀλλʼ οὐχʼ ὑφʼ ἓν πάντες. οὐδέν. σοὶ δὲ ἀπολλυμένων τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἡ θύρα κέκλεισται; οὐκ ἔξεστιν ἀποθανεῖν; ἔξεστιν. οὐᾶ, βασιλεὺς καὶ τὸ τοῦ Διὸς σκῆπτρον ἔχων. τί οὖν εἶ; ποιμὴν ταῖς ἀληθείαις· οὕτως γὰρ κλάεις ὡς οἱ ποιμένες, ὅταν λύκος ἁρπάσῃ τι τῶν προβάτων αὐτῶν· καὶ οὗτοι δὲ πρόβατά εἰσιν οἱ ὑπὸ σοῦ ἀρχόμενοι. τί δὲ καὶ ἤρχου; μή τι ὄρεξις ὑμῖν ἐκινδυνεύετο, μή τι ἔκκλισις, μή τι ὁρμή, μή τι ἀφορμή; οὔ, ἀλλὰ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ μου τὸ γυναικάριον ἡρπάγη. οὐκ οὖν κέρδος μέγα στερηθῆναι μοιχικοῦ γυναικαρίου; καταφρονηθῶμεν οὖν ὑπὸ τῶν Τρώων; ἐν τίνι οὖν ἔστι τὸ ἀγαθόν, ἐπειδὴ ἐν τούτοις οὐκ ἔστιν; εἰπὲ ἡμῖν, κύριε ἄγγελε καὶ κατάσκοπε. ὅπου οὐ δοκεῖτε οὐδὲ θέλετε ζητῆσαι αὐτό. εἰ γὰρ ἠθέλετε, εὕρετε ἂν αὐτὸ ἐν ὑμῖν ὂν οὐδʼ ἂν ἔξω ἐπλάζεσθε οὐδʼ ἂν ἐζητεῖτε τὰ ἀλλότρια ὡς ἴδια. ἐπιστρέψατε αὐτοὶ ἐφʼ ἑαυτούς, καταμάθετε τὰς προλήψεις ἃς ἔχετε. ποῖόν τι φαντάζεσθε τὸ ἀγαθόν; τὸ εὔρουν, τὸ εὐδαιμονικόν, τὸ ἀπαραπόδιστον. ἄγε, μέγα δʼ αὐτὸ φυσικῶς οὐ φαντάζεσθε; ἀξιόλογον οὐ φαντάζεσθε; ἀβλαβὲς οὐ φαντάζεσθε; ἐν ποίᾳ οὖν ὕλῃ δεῖ ζητεῖν τὸ εὔρουν καὶ ἀπαραπόδιστον; ἐν τῇ δούλῃ ἢ ἐν τῇ ἐλευθέρᾳ; ἐν τῇ ἐλευθέρᾳ. τὸ σωμάτιον οὖν ἐλεύθερον ἔχετε ἢ δοῦλον; οὐκ ἴσμεν. οὐκ ἴστε ὅτι πυρετοῦ δοῦλόν ἐστιν, ποδάγρας, ὀφθαλμίας, δυσεντερίας, τυράννου, πυρός, σιδήρου, παντὸς τοῦ ἰσχυροτέρου; ναὶ δοῦλον. πῶς οὖν ἔτι ἀνεμπόδιστον εἶναί τι δύναται τῶν τοῦ σώματος; πῶς δὲ μέγα ἢ ἀξιόλογον τὸ φύσει νεκρόν, ἡ γῆ, ὁ πηλός; τί οὖν; οὐδὲν ἔχετε ἐλεύθερον; μήποτε οὐδέν. καὶ τίς ὑμᾶς ἀναγκάσαι δύναται συγκαταθέσθαι τῷ ψευδεῖ φαινομένῳ; οὐδείς. τίς δὲ μὴ συγκαταθέσθαι τῷ φαινομένῳ ἀληθεῖ;

οὐδείς. ἔχετε οὖν καὶ ἐν τούτοις ἀκώλυτον καὶ ἐλεύθερον. ταλαίπωροι, τοῦτο ἐξεργάζεσθε, τούτου ἐπιμέλεσθε, ἐνταῦθα ζητεῖτε τὸ ἀγαθόν. καὶ πῶς ἐνδέχεται μηδὲν ἔχοντα, γυμνόν, ἄοικον, ἀνέστιον, αὐχμῶντα, ἄδουλον, ἄπολιν διεξάγειν εὐρόως; ἰδοὺ ἀπέσταλκεν ὑμῖν ὁ θεὸς τὸν δείξοντα ἔργῳ, ὅτι ἐνδέχεται. ἴδετέ με, ἄοικός εἰμι, ἄπολις, ἀκτήμων, ἄδουλος· χαμαὶ κοιμῶμαι· οὐ γυνή, οὐ παιδία, οὐ πραιτωρίδιον, ἀλλὰ γῆ μόνον καὶ οὐρανὸς καὶ ἓν τριβωνάριον. καὶ τί μοι λείπει ν με πῶς δʼ ἐντυγχάνω τούτοις, οὓς ὑμεῖς φοβεῖσθε καὶ θαυμάζετε;

ἄκουε, τί λέγει ἐκεῖνος πυρέσσων πρὸς τοὺς παριόντας· κακαί, κεφαλαί, οὐ μενεῖτε; ἀλλʼ ἀθλητῶν μὲν ὄλεθρον ἢ μάχην ὀψόμενοι ἄπιτε ὁδὸν τοσαύτην εἰς Ὀλυμπίαν· πυρετοῦ δὲ καὶ ἀνθρώπου μάχην ἰδεῖν οὐ βούλεσθε; ταχύ γʼ ἂν ὁ τοιοῦτος ἐνεκάλεσεν τῷ θεῷ καταπεπομφότι αὐτὸν ὡς παρʼ ἀξίαν αὐτῷ χρωμένῳ, ὅς γε ἐνεκαλλωπίζετο ταῖς περιστάσεσι καὶ θέαμα εἶναι ἠξίου τῶν παριόντων. ἐπὶ τίνι γὰρ ἐγκαλέσει; ὅτι εὐσχημονεῖ;

    "english": "One of you, seemingly inclined toward Cynicism, asks what kind of man a Cynic must be and what the preconception of the vocation is. We shall consider this at leisure, but I have this much to tell you now: anyone who attempts such a task without God is under divine wrath and merely wishes to disgrace himself in public. You cannot simply walk into a well-ordered house and claim the role of steward; the master of the house will notice and throw you out. So it is in this great city of the world; there is a Master who orders everything. You are the sun? Then perform the sun's work. You are a bull? Then fight for the herd. But if you are merely a drone claiming the kingdom of the bees, you will be destroyed.\n\nDo not imagine that Cynicism is merely wearing a rough cloak, sleeping on hard ground, carrying a staff and wallet, and begging from those you meet, or reviling people who wear luxury. If that is your image of it, stay far away; it is nothing to you. But if you understand the reality, look at the magnitude of the undertaking. First, in your own ruling faculty, you must become pure. You must banish anger, rage, envy, and pity. You must have no private desires for girls, reputation, or sweet cakes. Ordinary men have walls and houses to hide their private shame; the Cynic has only his self-respect (aidos) as a shield. If he loses that, he is naked and indecent under the open sky.\n\nKnow this: the true Cynic is a messenger sent from Zeus to humanity regarding good and evil. He is sent to show them they have wandered, that they seek the essence of good and evil where it is not, and fail to see where it is. He is a scout, like Diogenes, who reports back that death, poverty, and lack of reputation are not evils, but that the only true enemy is our own moral weakness. He must mount the tragic stage and cry out like Socrates: 'O men, where are you rushing? You are blind! You seek happiness in gold and power, but it is not there. Look at me! I am without a home, without a city, without property, without slaves. I sleep on the ground; I have no wife, no children, no palace—only earth, sky, and one rough cloak. And yet, am I not free? Am I not happy? Does God not treat me as a King?'\n\nYou ask about marriage and family? In the present state of the world, which is like a battlefield, the Cynic must be undistracted, devoted entirely to the service of God. If he is tied down by the duties of a husband and father—providing heating, wool, oil, and cribs—how can he oversee the rest of mankind? The Cynic has made all humanity his family; men are his sons, women his daughters. He cares for them all as a father and a brother, as a minister of the common Father, Zeus.\n\nDo not ask if he will engage in politics. Fool! What greater politics is there than this? He does not govern a corner of Athens or Corinth; he governs humanity, teaching them about happiness and misery. And consider his body: he must not be repulsive or dirty, lest he drive men away. His purity must be radiant. He must have the endurance to be beaten like a donkey, yet love the one who beats him as if he were the father or brother of the aggressor.\n\nTherefore, consult the Divinity before you attempt this. Know yourself. Look at your shoulders; consider your thighs. This is an Olympic contest you are entering, not a cheap local match. In the Olympics, you must follow strict discipline, eat by rules, and face the risk of public disgrace. If you enter casually, you will be mocked. As Hector said to Andromache: 'Go into the house and weave.' Know your own capacity, and do not attempt the work of giants if you are not prepared.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus redefines Cynicism not as a lifestyle of rudeness or mere poverty, but as a divine vocation and the highest form of Stoic practice. The 'True Cynic' acts as a 'Messenger' (angelos) and 'Scout' (kataskopos) for humanity, demonstrating through his own life that happiness is independent of external circumstances (indifferents) like wealth, status, or comfort. The text emphasizes that one cannot simply imitate the external trappings of philosophy (the cloak and staff) without the internal transformation of the 'ruling faculty' (hegemonikon). The Cynic sacrifices private ties (marriage, citizenship in a specific state) to serve the 'Cosmopolis' (the universal city of gods and men), acting as a moral mirror to society.

    "english": "First, say to yourself who you wish to be, and only then act accordingly! Look at the athletes: a long-distance runner does not train like a sprinter or a pentathlete. Look at the crafts: a carpenter does the work of a carpenter, not a smith. But you? If you do not define your goal, you act at random. You call yourself a philosopher, yet you invite people to hear you speak as if you were a performer, seeking only their applause. You ask, 'Did you hear how well I described the battle?' Fool! Does a doctor invite patients to his house to admire him? No! The patients come to the doctor because they are in pain. Understand this clearly: the school of a philosopher is a hospital, not a theater. You should not walk out of here feeling pleased; you should leave in pain! Why? Because you come to me sick—one with a dislocated will, another with an abscess of vanity, another with a fever of desire. Am I then to sit here spinning pretty phrases and reciting poetry so that you may clap your hands and leave exactly as sick as you arrived? Is this why you left your parents and your homes? To shout 'Bravo' at a lecturer? Shame on you! Stop disgracing the gods and these holy teachings by turning them into a show. True philosophy does not aim to be admired for its style; it aims to silence the audience with the realization of their own wretchedness, forcing them to seek a cure.",
    "notes": "This section (Discourses 3.23) presents Epictetus's definitive model of the Stoic classroom as an 'iatreion'—a physician's surgery or hospital. The core lesson is that philosophy is a therapeutic process designed to heal the 'diseases of the soul' (vice, false judgments, and unregulated passions). Epictetus harshly criticizes 'epideictic' display—speaking merely to show off rhetoric or gain praise. He argues that if a student leaves a lecture feeling entertained rather than convicted of their errors, the education has failed. Practical application requires the student to approach philosophy not as an intellectual hobby or a performance, but as a painful, necessary medical intervention to correct their character (prohairesis).",

καὶ οὐ τοῦτό φημι, ὅτι οὐκ ἐπιμελητέον τοῦ μὴ οἰμώζειν αὐτήν, ἀλλʼ ὅτι οὐ δεῖ θέλειν τὰ ἀλλότρια ἐξ ἅπαντος. λύπη δʼ ἡ ἄλλου ἀλλότριόν ἐστιν, ἡ δʼ ἐμὴ ἐμόν. ἐγὼ οὖν τὸ μὲν ἐμὸν παύσω ἐξ ἅπαντος, ἐπʼ ἐμοὶ γάρ ἐστιν· τὸ δʼ ἀλλότριον πειράσομαι κατὰ δύναμιν, ἐξ ἅπαντος δʼ οὐ πειράσομαι. εἰ δὲ μή, θεομαχήσω, ἀντιθήσω πρὸς τὸν Δία, ἀντιδιατάξομαι αὐτῷ πρὸς τὰ ὅλα. καὶ τἀπίχειρα τῆς θεομαχίας ταύτης καὶ ἀπειθείας οὐ παῖδες παίδων ἐκτίσουσιν, ἀλλʼ αὐτὸς ἐγὼ μεθʼ ἡμέραν, νυκτὸς διὰ τῶν ἐνυπνίων ἐκπηδῶν, ταρασσόμενος, πρὸς πᾶσαν ἀπαγγελίαν τρέμων, ἐξ ἐπιστολῶν ἀλλοτρίων ἠρτημένην ἔχων τὴν ἐμαυτοῦ ἀπάθειαν. ἀπὸ Ῥώμης τις ἥκει. μόνον μή τι κακόν. μόνον μή τι κακόν. οὐχ ἱκανὸν ἐκεῖ σε ἀτυχεῖν, ὅπου αὐτὸς εἶ, ἀλλὰ καὶ πέραν θαλάσσης καὶ διὰ γραμμάτων; οὕτως ἀσφαλῶς σοι τὰ πράγματα ἔχει; — τί οὖν, ἂν ἀποθάνωσιν οἱ ἐκεῖ φίλοι; — τί γὰρ ἂν ἄλλο ἢ οἱ θνητοὶ ἀπέθανον; ἢ πῶς ἅμα μὲν γηρᾶσαι θέλεις, ἅμα δὲ μηδενὸς τῶν στεργομένων μὴ ε οὐκ οἶσθʼ, ὅτι ἐν τῷ μακρῷ χρόνῳ πολλὰ καὶ ποικίλα ἀποβαίνειν ἀνάγκη, τοῦ μὲν πυρετὸν γενέσθαι κρείττονα, τοῦ δὲ λῃστήν, τοῦ δὲ τύραννον; τοιοῦτο γὰρ τὸ περιέχον, τοιοῦτον οἱ συνόντες, ψύχη καὶ καύματα καὶ τροφαὶ ἀσύμμετροι καὶ ὁδοιπορίαι καὶ πλοῦς καὶ ἄνεμοι καὶ περιστάσεις ποικίλαι· τὸν μὲν ἀπώλεσαν, τὸν δʼ ἐξώρισαν, τὸν δʼ εἰς πρεσβείαν, ἄλλον δʼ εἰς στρατείαν ἐνέβαλον. κάθησο τοίνυν πρὸς πάντα ταῦτα ἐπτοημένος, πενθῶν, ἀτυχῶν, δυστυχῶν, ἐξ ἄλλου ἠρτημένος καὶ τούτου οὐχ ἑνός, οὐ δυεῖν, ἀλλὰ μυρίων ἐπὶ μυρίοις. ταῦτα ἤκουες παρὰ τοῖς φιλοσόφοις, ταῦτʼ ἐμάνθανες; οὐκ οἶσθʼ, ὅτι στρατεία τὸ χρῆμά ἐστιν; τὸν μὲν δεῖ φυλάττειν, τὸν δὲ κατασκοπήσοντα ἐξιέναι, τὸν δὲ καὶ πολεμήσοντα· οὐχ οἷόν τʼ εἶναι πάντας ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ οὐδʼ ἄμεινον. σὺ δʼ ἀφεὶς ἐκτελεῖν τὰ προστάγματα τοῦ στρατηγοῦ ἐγκαλεῖς, ὅταν τί σοι προσταχθῇ τραχύτερον, καὶ οὐ παρακολουθεῖς, οἷον ἀποφαίνεις, ὅσον ἐπὶ σοί, τὸ στράτευμα, ὅτι ἄν σε πάντες μιμήσωνται, οὐ τάφρον σκάψει τις, οὐ χάρακα περιβαλεῖ, οὐκ ἀγρυπνήσει, οὐ κινδυνεύσει, ἀλλὰ ἄχρηστος δόξει στρατεύεσθαι. πάλιν ἐν πλοίῳ ναύτης ἂν πλέῃς, μίαν χώραν κάτεχε καὶ ταύτην προσλιπάρει· ἂν δʼ ἐπὶ τὸν ἱστὸν ἀναβῆναι δέῃ, μὴ θέλε, ἂν εἰς τὴν πρῴραν διαδραμεῖν, μὴ θέλε· καὶ τίς ἀνέξεταί σου κυβερνήτης; οὐχὶ δʼ ὡς σκεῦος ἄχρηστον ἐκβαλεῖ, οὐδὲν ἄλλο ἢ ἐμπόδιον καὶ κακὸν παράδειγμα τῶν ἄλλων ναυτῶν; οὕτως δὲ καὶ ἐνθάδε· στρατεία τίς ἐστιν ὁ βίος ἑκάστου καὶ αὕτη μακρὰ καὶ ποικίλη. τηρεῖν σε δεῖ τὸ τοῦ στρατιώτου καὶ τοῦ στρατηγοῦ πρὸς νεῦμα πράσσειν ἕκαστα· εἰ οἷόν τε, μαντευόμενον ἃ θέλει. οὐδὲ γὰρ ὅμοιος ἐκεῖνος ὁ στρατηγὸς καὶ οὗτος οὔτε κατὰ τὴν ἰσχὺν οὔτε κατὰ τὴν τοῦ ἤθους ὑπεροχήν. τέταξαι ἐν πόλει ἡγεμονίᾳ — ἡδὺ γάρ ἐστιν. — τίς οὔ φησιν; ἀλλὰ καὶ ζωμὸς ἡδύς ἐστι καὶ γυνὴ καλὴ ἡδύ ἐστιν. τί ἄλλο λέγουσιν οἱ τέλος ποιούμενοι τὴν ἡδονήν; οὐκ αἰσθάνῃ, τίνων ἀνθρώπων φωνὴν ἀφῆκας; ὅτι Ἐπικουρείων καὶ κιναίδων; εἶτα τὰ ἐκείνων ἔργα πράσσων καὶ τὰ δόγματα ἔχων τοὺς λόγους ἡμῖν λέγεις τοὺς Ζήνωνος καὶ Σωκράτους; οὐκ ἀπορρίψεις ὡς μακροτάτω τἀλλότρια, οἷς κοσμῇ μηδέν σοι προσήκουσιν; ἢ τί ἄλλο θέλουσιν ἐκεῖνοι ἢ καθεύδειν ἀπαραποδίστως καὶ ἀναναγκάστως καὶ ἀναστάντες ἐφʼ ἡσυχίας χασμήσασθαι καὶ τὸ πρόσωπον ἀποπλῦναι, εἶτα γράψαι καὶ ἀναγνῶναι ἃ θέλουσιν, εἶτα φλυαρῆσαί τί ποτʼ ἐπαινούμενοι ὑπὸ τῶν φίλων, ὅ τι ἂν λέγωσιν, εἶτα εἰς περίπατον προελθόντες καὶ ὀλίγα περιπατήσαντες λούσασθαι, εἶτα φαγεῖν, εἶτα κοιμηθῆναι, οἵαν δὴ κοίτην καθεύδειν τοὺς τοιούτους εἰκός — τί ἄν τις λέγοι; ἔξεστιν γὰρ τεκμαίρεσθαι. ἄγε, φέρε μοι καὶ σὺ τὴν σαυτοῦ διατριβήν, ἣν ποθεῖς, ζηλωτὰ τῆς ἀληθείας καὶ Σωκράτους καὶ Διογένους. τί θέλεις ἐν Ἀθήναις ποιεῖν; ταῦτα αὐτά; μή τι ἕτερα; τί οὖν Στωικὸν σαυτὸν εἶναι λέγεις; εἶτα οἱ μὲν τῆς Ῥωμαίων πολιτείας καταψευδόμενοι κολάζονται πικρῶς, τοὺς δʼ οὕτως μεγάλου καὶ σεμνοῦ καταψευδομένους πράγματος καὶ ὀνόματος ἀθῴους ἀπαλλάττεσθαι δεῖ; ἢ τοῦτό γε οὐ δυνατόν, ἀλλʼ ὁ νόμος θεῖος καὶ ἰσχυρὸς καὶ ἀναπόδραστος οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ τὰς μεγίστας εἰσπρασσόμενος κολάσεις παρὰ τῶν τὰ μέγιστα ἁμαρτανόντων; τί γὰρ λέγει; ὁ προσποιούμενος τὰ μηδὲν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἔστω ἀλαζών, ἔστω κενόδοξος· ὁ ἀπειθῶν τῇ θείᾳ διοικήσει ἔστω ταπεινός, ἔστω δοῦλος, λυπείσθω, φθονείτω, ἐλεείτω, τὸ κεφάλαιον πάντων, δυστυχείτω, θρηνείτω. τί οὖν; θέλεις με τὸν δεῖνα θεραπεύειν; ἐπὶ θύρα ι ς — ναί· τὸν σκυτέα γὰρ οὐ θαυμάζω. — μηδὲ τὸν πλούσιον. — οὐδὲ τὸν κηπουρὸν κολακεύσω. — μηδὲ τὸν πλούσιον. πῶς οὖν τύχω οὗ δέομαι; — ἐγὼ δέ σοι λέγω ὅτι ὡς τευξόμενος ἀπέρχου; — τί οὖν ἔτι πορεύομαι; — ἵνʼ ἀπέλθῃς, ἵνα ἀποδεδωκὼς ᾖς τὰ τοῦ πολίτου ἔργα, τὰ ἀδελφοῦ, τὰ φίλου. καὶ λοιπὸν μέμνησο, ὅτι πρὸς σκυτέα ἀφῖξαι, πρὸς λαχανοπώλην, οὐδενὸς μεγάλου ἢ σεμνοῦ ἔχοντα τὴν ἐξουσίαν, κἂν αὐτὸ πολλοῦ πωλῇ. ὡς ἐπὶ τὰς θίδρακας ἀπέρχῃ· ὀβολοῦ γάρ εἰσιν, ταλάντου δʼ οὐκ εἰσίν. οὕτως κἀνταῦθα. τοῦ ἐπὶ θύρας ἐλθεῖν ἄξιον τὸ πρᾶγμα· ἔστω, ἀφίξομαι. τοῦ διαλεχθῆναι οὕτως· ἔστω, διαλεχθήσομαι. ἀλλὰ καὶ τὴν χεῖρα δεῖ καταφιλῆσαι καὶ θωπεῦσαι διʼ ἐπαίνου. ἄπαγε, ταλάντου ἐστίν· οὐ λυσιτελεῖ μοι οὐδὲ τῇ πόλει οὐδὲ τοῖς φίλοις ἀπολέσαι καὶ πολίτην ἀγαθὸν καὶ φίλον. ἀλλὰ δόξεις μὴ προτεθυμῆσθαι μὴ ἀνύσας. πάλιν ἐπελάθου, τίνος ἕνεκα ἐλήλυθας; οὐκ οἶσθʼ, ὅτι ἀνὴρ καλὸς καὶ ἀγαθὸς οὐδὲν ποιεῖ τοῦ δόξαι ἕνεκα, ἀλλὰ τοῦ πεπρᾶχθαι καλῶς; — τί οὖν ὄφελος αὐτῷ τοῦ πρᾶξαι καλῶς; — τί δʼ ὄφελος τῷ γράφοντι τὸ Δίωνος ὄνομα, ὡς χρὴ γράφειν; αὐτὸ τὸ γράψαι. — ἔπαθλον οὖν οὐδέν; — σὺ δὲ ζητεῖς ἔπαθλον ἀνδρὶ ἀγαθῷ μεῖζον τοῦ τὰ καλὰ καὶ δίκαια πράττειν; ἐν Ὀλυμπίᾳ δʼ οὐδεὶς ἄλλο οὐδέν, ἀλλʼ ἀρκεῖν σοι δοκεῖ τὸ ἐστεφανῶσθαι Ὀλύμπια. οὕτως σοι μικρὸν καὶ οὐδενὸς ἄξιον εἶναι φαίνεται τὸ εἶναι καλὸν καὶ ἀγαθὸν καὶ εὐδαίμονα; πρὸς ταῦτα ὑπὸ θεῶν εἰς τὴν πόλιν ταύτην εἰσηγμένος καὶ ἤδη τῶν ἀνδρὸς ἔργων ὀφείλων ἅπτεσθαι τιτθὰς ἐπιποθεῖς καὶ μάμμην καὶ κάμπτει σε καὶ ἀποθηλύνει κλαίοντα γύναια μωρά; οὕτως οὐδέποτε παύσει παιδίον· ὢν νήπιον; οὐκ οἶσθʼ, ὅτι ὁ τὰ παιδίου ποιῶν ὅσῳ πρεσβύτερος τοσούτῳ γελοιότερος; ἐν Ἀθήναις δʼ οὐδένα ἑώρας εἰς οἶκον αὐτοῦ φοιτῶν; — ὃν ἐβουλόμην. — καὶ ἐνθάδε τοῦτον θέλε ὁρᾶν καὶ ὃν βούλει ὄψει· μόνον μὴ ταπεινῶς, μὴ μετʼ ὀρέξεως ἢ ἐκκλίσεως καὶ ἔσται τὰ σὰ καλῶς. τοῦτο δʼ οὐκ ἐν τῷ ἐλθεῖν ἐστιν οὐδʼ ἐν τῷ ἐπὶ θύραις στῆναι, ἀλλʼ ἔνδον ἐν τοῖς δόγμασιν. ὅταν τὰ ἐκτὸς καὶ ἀπροαίρετα ἠτιμακὼς ᾖς καὶ μηδὲν αὐτῶν σὸν ἡγημένος, μόνα δʼ ἐκεῖνα σά, τὸ κρῖναι καλῶς, τὸ ὑπολαβεῖν, τὸ ὁρμῆσαι, τὸ ὀρεχθῆναι, τὸ ἐκκλῖναι, ποῦ ἔτι κολακείας τόπος, ποῦ ταπεινοφροσύνης; τί ἔτι ποθεῖς τὴν ἡσυχίαν τὴν ἐκεῖ, τί τοὺς συνήθεις τόπους; ἔκδεξαι βραχὺ καὶ τούτους πάλιν ἕξεις συνήθεις. εἶτα ἂν οὕτως ἀγεννῶς ἔχῃς, πάλιν καὶ τούτων ἀπαλλαττόμενος κλαῖε καὶ στένε. πῶς οὖν γένωμαι φιλόστοργος;— ὡς γενναῖος, ὡς εὐτυχής· οὐδέποτε γὰρ αἱρεῖ ὁ λόγος ταπεινὸν εἶναι οὐδὲ κατακλᾶσθαι οὐδʼ ἐξ ἄλλου κρέμασθαι οὐδὲ μέμψασθαί ποτε θεὸν ἢ ἄνθρωπον. οὕτως μοι γίνου φιλόστοργος ὡς ταῦτα τηρήσων· εἰ δὲ διὰ τὴν φιλοστοργίαν ταύτην, τ καὶ τί κωλύει φιλεῖν τινα ὡς θνητόν, ὡς ἀποδημητικόν; ἢ Σωκράτης οὐκ ἐφίλει τοὺς παῖδας τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ; ἀλλʼ ὡς ἐλεύθερος, ὡς μεμνημένος, ὅτι πρῶτον δεῖ θεοῖς εἶναι φίλον. διὰ τοῦτο οὐδὲν παρέβη τῶν πρεπόντων ἀνδρὶ ἀγαθῷ οὔτʼ ἀπολογούμενος οὐθʼ ὑποτιμώμενος οὔτʼ ἔτι πρόσθεν βουλεύων ἢ στρατευόμενος. ἡμεῖς δὲ πάσης προφάσεως πρὸς τὸ ἀ γ διʼ οὐδένα δὲ προσήκει δυστυχεῖν, ἀλλὰ εὐτυχεῖν διὰ πάντας, μάλιστα δὲ διὰ τὸν θεὸν τὸν ἐπὶ τοῦτο ἡμᾶς κατασκευάσαντα. ἄγε, Διογένης δʼ οὐκ ἐφίλει οὐδένα, ὃς οὕτως ἥμερος ἦν καὶ φιλάνθρωπος, ὥστε ὑπὲρ τοῦ κοινοῦ τῶν ἀνθρώπων τοσούτους πόνους καὶ ταλαιπωρίας τοῦ σώματος ἄσμενος ἀναδέχεσθαι; ἀλλʼ ἐφίλει πῶς; ὡς τοῦ Διὸς διάκονον ἔδει, ἅμα μὲν κηδόμενος, ἅμα δʼ ὡς τῷ θεῷ ὑποτεταγμένος. διὰ τοῦτο πᾶσα γῆ πατρὶς ἦν ἐκείνῳ μόνῳ, ἐξαίρετος δʼ οὐδεμία· καὶ ἁλοὺς οὐκ ἐπόθει τὰς Ἀθήνας οὐδὲ τοὺς ἐκεῖ συνήθεις καὶ φίλους, ἀλλʼ αὐτοῖς τοῖς πειραταῖς συνήθης ἐγίνετο καὶ ἐπανορθοῦν ἐπειρᾶτο. καὶ πραθεὶς ὕστερον ἐν Κορίνθῳ διῆγεν οὕτως ὡς πρόσθεν ἐν Ἀθήναις καὶ εἰς Περραιβοὺς δʼ ἂν ἀπελθὼν ὡσαύτως εἶχεν. οὕτως ἐλευθερία γίνεται. διὰ τοῦτο ἔλεγεν ὅτι ἐξ οὗ μʼ Ἀντισθένης ἠλευθέρωσεν, οὐκέτι ἐδούλευσα. πῶς ἠλευθέρωσεν; ἄκουε, τί λέγει· ἐδίδαξέν με τὰ ἐμὰ καὶ τὰ οὐκ ἐμά. κτῆσις οὐκ ἐμή· συγγενεῖς, οἰκεῖοι, φίλοι, φήμη, συνήθεις τόποι, διατριβή, πάντα ταῦτα ὅτι ἀλλότρια. σὸν οὖν τί; χρῆσις φαντασιῶν. τίς οὖν ἔτι ἔχει μου ἐξουσίαν; Φίλιππος ἢ Ἀλέξανδρος ἢ Περδίκκας ἢ ὁ μέγας βασιλεύς; πόθεν αὐτοῖς; τὸν γὰρ ὑπʼ ἀνθρώπου μέλλοντα ἡττᾶσθαι πολὺ πρότερον ὑπὸ τῶν πραγμάτων δεῖ ἡττᾶσθαι. οὗτινος οὖν οὐχ ἡδονὴ κρείττων ἐστίν, οὐ πόνος, οὐ δόξα, οὐ πλοῦτος, δύναται δʼ, ὅταν αὐτῷ δόξῃ, τὸ σωμάτιον ὅλον προσπτύσας τινὶ ἀπελθεῖν, τίνος ἔτι οὗτος δοῦλός ἐστιν, τίνι ὑποτέτακται; εἰ δʼ ἡδέως ἐν Ἀθήναις διῆγεν καὶ ἥττητο ταύτης τῆς διατριβῆς, ἐπὶ παντὶ ἂν ἦν τὰ ἐκείνου πράγματα, ὁ ἰσχυρότερος κύριος ἂν ἦν λυπῆσαι αὐτόν. πῶς ἂν δοκεῖς τοὺς πειρατὰς ἐκολάκευεν, ἵνʼ αὐτὸν Ἀθηναίων τινὶ πωλήσωσιν, ἵνʼ ἴδῃ ποτὲ τὸν Πειραιᾶ τὸν καλὸν καὶ τὰ μακρὰ τείχη καὶ τὴν ἀκρόπολιν; τίς ὢν ε δοῦλος καὶ ταπεινός· καὶ τί σοι ὄφελος; — οὔ· ἀλλʼ ἐλεύθερος. — δεῖξον, πῶς ἐλεύθερος. ἰδοὺ ἐπείληπταί σου τίς ποτε οὗτος ὁ ἐξάγων σε ἀπὸ τῆς συνήθους σοι διατριβῆς καὶ λέγει δοῦλος ἐμὸς εἶ· ἐπʼ ἐμοὶ γάρ ἐστι κωλῦσαί σε διάγειν ὡς θέλεις, ἐπʼ ἐμοὶ τὸ ἀνεῖναί σε, τὸ ταπεινοῦν· ὅταν θέλω, πάλιν εὐφραίνῃ καὶ μετέωρος πορεύῃ εἰς Ἀθήνας. τί λέγεις πρὸς τοῦτον τὸν δουλαγωγοῦντά σε; ποῖον αὐτῷ καρπιστὴν δίδως; ἢ οὐδʼ ὅλως ἀντιβλέπεις, ἀλλʼ ἀφεὶς τοὺς πολλοὺς λόγους ἱκετεύεις, ἵνα ἀφεθῇς; ἄνθρωπε, εἰς φυλακήν σε δεῖ χαίροντα ἀπιέναι, σπεύδοντα, φθάνοντα τοὺς ἀπάγοντας. εἶτά μοι σὺ μὲν ἐν Ῥώμῃ διάγειν ὀκνεῖς, τὴν Ἑλλάδα ποθεῖς; ὅταν δʼ ἀποθνῄσκειν δέῃ, καὶ τότε μέλλεις ἡμῶν κατακλαίειν, ὅτι τὰς Ἀθήνας οὐ μέλλεις βλέπειν καὶ ἐν Λυκείῳ οὐ περιπατήσεις; ἐπὶ τοῦτο ἀπεδήμησας; τούτου ἕνεκα ἐζήτησάς τινι συμβαλεῖν, ἵνʼ ὠφεληθῇς ὑπʼ αὐτοῦ; ποίαν ὠφέλειαν; συλλογισμοὺς ἵνʼ ἀναλύσῃς ἑκτικώτερον ἢ ἐφοδεύσης ὑποθετικούς; καὶ διὰ ταύτην τὴν αἰτίαν ἀδελφὸν ἀπέλιπες, πατρίδα, φίλους, οἰκείους, ἵνα ταῦτα μαθὼν ἐπανέλθῃς; ὥστʼ οὐχ ὑπὲρ εὐσταθείας ἀπεδήμεις, οὐχ ὑπὲρ ἀταραξίας, οὐχ ἵνʼ ἀβλαβὴς γενόμενος μηκέτι μηδένα μέμφῃ, μηδενὶ ἐγκαλῇς, μηδείς σε ἀδικῇ καὶ οὕτως τὰς σχέσεις ἀποσῴζῃς ἀπαραποδίστως; καλὴν ἐστείλω ταύτην τὴν ἐμπορίαν, συλλογισμοὺς καὶ μεταπίπτοντας καὶ ὑποθετικούς· κἄν σοι φανῇ, ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ καθίσας πρόγραψον ὡς οἱ φαρμακοπῶλαι. οὐκ ἀρνήσῃ καὶ ὅσα ἔμαθες εἰδέναι, ἵνα μὴ διαβάλῃς τὰ θεωρήματα ὡς ἄχρηστα; τί σοι κακὸν ἐποίησεν φιλοσοφία; τί σε ἠδίκησε Χρύσιππος, ἵνʼ αὐτοῦ τοὺς πόνους ἔργῳ αὐτὸς ἀχρήστους ἐξελέγχῃς; οὐκ ἤρκει σοι τὰ ἐκεῖ κακά, ὅσα εἶχες αἴτια τοῦ λυπεῖσθαι καὶ πενθεῖν, εἰ καὶ μὴ ἀπεδήμησας, ἀλλὰ πλείω προσέλαβες; κἂν ἄλλους πάλιν ἔχῃς συνήθεις καὶ φίλους, ἕξεις πλείονα τοῦ οἰμώζειν αἴτια, κἂν πρὸς ἄλλην χώραν προσπαθῇς. τί οὖν ζῇς; ἵνα λύπας ἄλλας ἐπʼ ἄλλαις περιβάλῃ, διʼ ἃς ἀτυχεῖς; εἶτά μοι καλεῖς τοῦτο φιλοστοργίαν; ποίαν, ἄνθρωπε, φιλοστοργίαν; εἰ ἀγαθόν ἐστιν, οὐδενὸς κακοῦ αἴτιον γίνεται· εἰ κακόν ἐστιν, οὐδέν μοι καὶ αὐτῇ ἐγὼ πρὸς τὰ ἀγαθὰ τὰ ἐμαυτοῦ πέφυκα, πρὸς κακὰ οὐ πέφυκα. τίς οὖν ἡ πρὸς τοῦτο ἄσκησις; πρῶτον μὲν ἡ ἀνωτάτω καὶ κυριωτάτη καὶ εὐθὺς ὥσπερ ἐν πύλαις, ὅταν τινὶ προσπάσχῃς, οὐδενὶ τῶν ἀναφαιρέτων, ἀλλά τινι τοιούτῳ γένει, οἷόν ἐστι χύτρα, οἷον ὑάλινον ποτήριον, ἵνʼ ὅταν καταγῇ, μεμνημένος μὴν οὕτως καὶ ἐνθάδʼ, ἐὰν παιδίον σαυτοῦ καταφιλῇς, ἐὰν ἀδελφόν, ἐὰν φίλον, μηδέποτε ἐπιδῷς τὴν φαντασίαν εἰς ἅπαν μηδὲ τὴν διάχυσιν ἐάσῃς προελθεῖν ἐφʼ ὅσον αὐτὴ θέλει, ἀλλʼ ἀντίσπασον, κώλυσον, οἷον οἱ τοῖς θριαμβεύουσιν ἐφεστῶτες ὄπισθεν καὶ ὑπομιμνῄσκοντες, ὅτι ἄνθρωποί εἰσιν. τοιοῦτόν τι καὶ σὺ ὑπομίμνῃσκε σεαυτόν, ὅτι θνητὸν φιλεῖς, οὐδὲν τῶν σεαυτοῦ φιλεῖς· ἐπὶ τοῦ παρόντος σοι δέδοται, οὐκ ἀναφαίρετον οὐδʼ εἰς ἅπαν, ἀλλʼ ὡς σῦκον, ὡς σταφυλή, τῇ τεταγμένῃ ὥρᾳ τοῦ ἔτους· ἂν δὲ χειμῶνος ἐπιποθῇς, μωρὸς εἶ. οὕτως κἂν τὸν υἱὸν ἢ τὸν φίλον τότε ποθῇς, ὅτε οὐ δέδοταί σοι, ἴσθι, ὅτι χειμῶνος σῦκον ἐπιποθεῖς. οἷον γάρ ἐστι χειμὼν πρὸς σῦκον, τοιοῦτόν ἐστι πᾶσα ἡ ἀπὸ τῶν ὅλων περίστασις πρὸς τὰ κατʼ αὐτὴν ἀναιρούμενα. καὶ λοιπὸν ἐν αὐτοῖς οἷς χαίρεις τινί, τὰς ἐναντίας φαντασίας σαυτῷ πρό σ αὔριον ἀποθανῇ, αὔριον ἀποδημήσεις ἢ σὺ ἢ ἐγὼ καὶ οὐκέτι ὀψόμεθα ἀλλήλους; — ἀλλὰ δύσφημά ἐστι ταῦτα. — καὶ γὰρ τῶν ἐπαοιδῶν ἔνιαι, ἀλλʼ ὅτι ὠφελοῦσιν, οὐκ ἐπιστρέφομαι, μόνον ὠφελείτω. σὺ δὲ δύσφημα καλεῖς ἄλλα ἢ τὰ κακοῦ τινος σημαντικά; δύσφημόν ἐστι δειλία, δύσφημον ἀγέννεια, πένθος, λύπη, ἀναισχυντία· ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα δύσφημά ἐστιν. καίτοι γε οὐδὲ ταῦτα ὀκνεῖν δεῖ φθέγγεσθαι ὑπὲρ φυλακῆς τῶν πραγμάτων. δύσφημον δέ μοι λέγεις ὄνομα φυσικοῦ τινὸς πράγματος σημαντικόν; λέγε δύσφημον εἶναι καὶ τὸ θερισθῆναι τοὺς στάχυας· ἀπώλειαν γὰρ σημαίνει τῶν σταχύων· ἀλλʼ οὐχὶ τοῦ κόσμου. λέγε δύσφημον καὶ τὸ φυλλορροεῖν καὶ τὸ ἰσχάδα γίνεσθαι ἀντὶ σύκου καὶ ἀσταφίδας ἐκ σταφυλῆς. πάντα γὰρ ταῦτα τῶν προτέρων εἰσὶν εἰς ἕτερα μεταβολαί· οὐκ ἀπώλεια, ἀλλὰ τεταγμένη τις οἰκονομία καὶ διοίκησις. τοῦτʼ ἔστιν ἀποδημία, καὶ τοῦτο θάνατος, μεταβολὴ μείζων ἐκ τοῦ νῦν ὄντος οὐκ εἰς τὸ μὴ ὄν, ἀλλʼ εἰς τὸ νῦν μὴ ὄν. — οὐκέτι οὖν ἔσομαι; — οὐκ ἔσει· ἀλλʼ ἄλλο τι, οὗ νῦν ὁ κόσμος χρείαν ἔχει. καὶ γὰρ σὺ ἐγένου οὐχ ὅτε σὺ ἠθέλησας, ἀλλʼ ὅτε ὁ κόσμος χρείαν ἔσχεν. διὰ τοῦτο ὁ καλὸς καὶ ἀγαθὸς μεμνημένος, τίς τʼ ἐστὶ καὶ πόθεν ἐλήλυθεν καὶ ὑπὸ τίνος γέγονεν, πρὸς μόνῳ τούτῳ ἐστίν, πῶς τὴν αὑτοῦ χώραν ἐκπληρώσῃ εὐτάκτως καὶ εὐπειθῶς τῷ θεῷ. ἔτι μʼ εἶναι θέλεις; ὡς ἐλεύθερος, ὡς γενναῖος, ὡς σὺ ἠθέλησας· σὺ γάρ με ἀκώλυτον ἐποίησας ἐν τοῖς ἐμοῖς. ἀλλʼ οὐκέτι μου χρείαν ἔχεις; καλῶς σοι γένοιτο· καὶ μέχρι νῦν διὰ σὲ ἔμενον, διʼ ἄλλον οὐδένα, καὶ νῦν σοι πειθόμενος ἀπέρχομαι. πῶς ἀπέρχῃ; πάλιν ὡς σὺ ἠθέλησας, ὡς ἐλεύθερος, ὡς ὑπηρέτης σός, ὡς ᾐσθημένος σου τῶν προσταγμάτων καὶ ἀπαγορευμάτων. μέχρι δʼ ἂν οὗ διατρίβω ἐν τοῖς σοῖς, τίνα με θέλεις εἶναι; ἄρχοντα ἢ ἰδιώτην, βουλευτὴν ἢ δημότην, στρατιώτην ἢ στρατηγόν, παιδευτὴν ποῦ δέ μʼ εἶναι θέλεις;

    "english": "Let not another's unnatural behavior become your evil. You were not born to be humiliated along with others, nor to share their bad fortune, but to share their good fortune. If someone is unfortunate, remember that he is unfortunate because of himself. For God made all men to be happy, to be stable. He provided resources for this: some things He gave to each man as his own, and some as not his own. The things that can be hindered, taken away, and compelled are not his own; those that cannot be hindered are his own. And naturally, He placed the essence of Good and Evil in what is our own, as became Him who cares for us and protects us like a Father.\n\n'But,' you say, 'I have parted from so-and-so, and he is grieving.'\n\nAnd why are you grieving? For what are you weeping over yourself? Did you not practice for this? Did you study these things as merely old wives' tales? You are worse than ravens and crows, which can fly wherever they wish, build their nests in new places, and cross the seas without groaning or longing for their former home. \n\n'Yes, but they are affected this way because they are irrational creatures.'\n\nHas reason, then, been given to us by the gods for the purpose of unhappiness and misery, so that we may pass our lives in wretchedness and mourning? Or should all men be immortal and no one leave home? Must we remain rooted like plants? And if one of our familiars leaves, must we sit and cry, and when he returns, dance and clap like children? Will we never wean ourselves and remember what we heard from the philosophers—unless we listened to them as if they were merely enchanting sorcerers?\n\nThis universe is a single city. The substance from which it is made is one, and it is necessary that there be a certain cycle of events: that one thing gives way to another, that some things dissolve while others come into being, some remain and others move. The world is full of friends: first the gods, then human beings, who are by nature akin to one another. It is necessary that some be with one another, and others separate; that we rejoice with those who are present, and not grieve for those who leave.\n\nMan, in addition to being by nature high-minded and contemptuous of all things outside the scope of his moral choice (prohairesis), also possesses the quality of not being rooted or attached to the earth, but of moving from place to place—sometimes for urgent needs, sometimes merely for the sake of the view. Such was the case with Odysseus. How many friends do you think he had in Thebes, in Argos, in Athens? And how many did he acquire while wandering? Yet he married where occasion offered, and begot children, and left them—not groaning or longing, nor leaving them like an orphan. For he knew that no man is an orphan, but that the Father of all helps everyone continually and forever. He had not merely heard as a phrase that Zeus is the Father of men; he thought of Him as his own Father, called Him so, and acted with his eyes fixed upon Him. Therefore, he was able to live happily everywhere.\n\nBut you—when your mother grieves because she does not see you, you say, 'My mother is unhappy.' Why? Because she has not learned these principles. I am not saying you shouldn't try to prevent her from lamenting, but that you must not desire what is not your own at all costs. Another's grief is another's affair; my grief is my own. I will stop my own grief at all costs, for that is in my power; the grief of another I will try to cure as far as I can, but I will not attempt it at all costs. Otherwise, I shall be fighting against God; I shall be setting myself in opposition to Zeus and his arrangement of the universe. And the penalty for this fighting against God and this disobedience will be paid not by your children’s children, but by you yourself—by day and by night, starting up from your dreams in terror, trembling at every message, having your peace of mind depend on the letters of others.\n\n'Someone has come from Rome.' 'I hope it is no bad news!'\n\nFool! What evil can happen to you in a place where you are not? Is it not enough for you to be unfortunate where you are, that you must be unfortunate across the sea and by letter as well? 'But what if my friends there die?' What else would they do but die, being mortals? Or do you wish to grow old while no one you love dies? Do you not know that in a long stretch of time many different things must happen—a fever overcomes one, a robber another, a tyrant another? Such is the nature of the atmosphere around us, such are our companions; cold, heat, improper diet, journeys, voyages, winds, and various circumstances destroy one man, banish another, send another on an embassy, and another to war. Sit down, then, fluttering at all these things, mourning, unfortunate, miserable, depending on others—and not just one or two, but ten thousand times ten thousand!\n\nIs this what you heard from the philosophers? Is this what you learned? Do you not know that life is a soldier's campaign? One man must stand guard, another go out to scout, another to fight. It is not possible for everyone to remain in the same place, nor is it better. But you, neglecting to execute the orders of the General, complain when something a bit rough is commanded of you. You do not realize to what extent you represent the army as bad, for if everyone imitates you, no one will dig a trench, no one will build a rampart, no one will stand watch, no one will take risks, but everyone will appear useless for the campaign. \n\nAgain, if you sail as a sailor in a ship, keep to one place and stick to it! If you are needed to climb the mast, refuse; if to run to the bow, refuse! What captain will tolerate you? Will he not throw you overboard like useless luggage, a hindrance and a bad example to the other sailors? So it is here: every man's life is a kind of campaign, and a long and varied one at that. You must maintain the character of a soldier and do everything at the nod of the General—and, if possible, divining what He wishes.\n\n'But I want to be in Athens.' \n\nAnd the fish wants to be in the water! Why do you call yourself a Stoic? If those who falsely claim Roman citizenship are punished severely, should those who falsely claim so great and dignified a calling and name get off scot-free? \n\n'Do you want me to pay court to such a person? To go to his door?'\n\nIf reason requires it for the sake of your country or your relatives, go. But do not go trembling or miserably. Go as a free man. You are not admiring the shoemaker or the rich man; you are performing the duty of a citizen. But remember, you are going to a shoemaker, to a vegetable seller—someone who has power over nothing great or dignified, even if he sells it for a high price. You are going as if to buy lettuce. It costs an obol, not a talent. So it is here. The matter of going to his door is worth this much; very well, I will go. The matter of speaking to him is worth this much; very well, I will speak. But must I also kiss his hand and flatter him with praise? Away with that! That is a talent's worth. It is not profitable for me, nor for the city, nor for my friends, to destroy a good citizen and a good friend.\n\n'But if I don't succeed, people will think I didn't try.'\n\nHave you forgotten again why you went? Do you not know that a good and noble man does nothing for the sake of appearance, but for the sake of having acted rightly? \n\n'What advantage does he gain from acting rightly?'\n\nWhat advantage does a man gain from writing the name 'Dion' as it ought to be written? The act of writing it. Is there no reward? Do you seek a reward for a good man greater than doing what is noble and just? At Olympia, you desire nothing else; it seems enough to you to be crowned victor. Does it seem to you so small and worthless a thing to be noble, good, and happy?\n\nStop crying like a child for your nurse and mamma! You are an old man; are you still an infant? Do you not know that the older a man is when he acts like a child, the more ridiculous he is?\n\nHow, then, shall I become affectionate? As a noble man, as a fortunate man. Reason never chooses to be abject, or broken, or dependent on others, or to blame God or man. Become affectionate in such a way that you maintain these rules. If, because of this 'affection' (or rather, weakness), you become a slave and miserable, it does not profit you. What prevents you from loving someone as a mortal, as someone who may leave? Did Socrates not love his children? But he loved them as a free man, as one who remembered that he must first be a friend to the gods. Therefore, he failed in nothing that was fitting for a good man.\n\nListen to what Diogenes says: 'Since Antisthenes set me free, I have ceased to be a slave.' How did he set him free? He taught him what was his own and what was not his own. Possessions were not his; nor kinsmen, nor family, nor friends, nor fame, nor familiar places. What then was his? The use of impressions. Who then has power over me anymore? Philip or Alexander or Perdiccas or the Great King? How can they? For he who is going to be conquered by a man must first have been conquered by things. \n\nTherefore, if you are shut up in a prison, go happily; go quickly. Why do you long for Athens? Is it to understand syllogisms more clearly? For this reason, you left your country and friends? What a fine trade you have made! \n\nWhat, then, is the training for this? First, the highest and principal training, standing as it were at the very entrance: when you feel an attachment to anything, not of the unalterable sort, but to something like a pot or a glass cup, so that if it is broken, you will not be disturbed. So too in this matter: if you kiss your own child, or your brother, or your friend, never give full rein to the impression, nor allow the effusion of spirit to go as far as it wishes, but tug it back, restrain it, like those who stand behind generals in a triumph and remind them that they are men. Remind yourself that you love a mortal, that you love nothing that is your own; it has been given to you for the present, not irrevocably, nor forever, but like a fig or a cluster of grapes at a fixed season of the year. If you long for it in winter, you are a fool. So also if you long for your son or your friend when it is not given to you, know that you are longing for a fig in winter.\n\nSay to yourself: 'Tomorrow, perhaps, you will die, or I will, and we shall not see each other again.'\n\n'But these are ill-omened words!'\n\nYou call 'ill-omened' that which signifies a natural process? Call the harvesting of ears of grain ill-omened, for it signifies the destruction of the ears! Call the falling of leaves ill-omened! All these are changes from the former state to another; not destruction, but a certain ordered economy and administration. Traveling is a change; death is a change—a greater one—from what now is, not into what is not, but into what is not now. \n\n'Shall I then no longer exist?'\n\nYou will not exist as you are now, but as something else of which the cosmos then has need. For you came into existence not when *you* chose, but when the cosmos had need of you.\n\nTherefore, the good and noble man, remembering who he is and whence he came, is devoted to this alone: how he may fill his post with discipline and obedience to God. 'Do You still wish me to exist? I will exist as a free man, as a noble man, as You wished; for You made me unhindered in what was my own. But have You no further need of me? Let it be well with You. I have remained until now for Your sake, for no other, and now I obey You and depart.'\n\n'How do you depart?'\n\n'Again, as You wished: as a free man, as Your servant, as one who has perceived Your commands and prohibitions.'\n\nKeep these thoughts ready by night and by day. Write them, read them, talk of them—to yourself and to others. And if some so-called 'undesirable' event happens, this first of all will relieve you: that it was not unexpected. For it is a great thing to be able to say, 'I knew that I begot a mortal.'\n\nWhen an impression bites you (for this is not in your power), fight against it with reason, conquer it. Do not let it grow strong or proceed to the next step, painting for you precisely what it wishes. If you are in Gyara, do not imagine the life in Rome and how many pleasures there were for you there. Instead, concentrate on this: how a man living in Gyara ought to live in Gyara with spirit and dignity. And if you are in Rome, do not imagine the life in Athens.\n\nLook! You are afraid idly; you desire in vain. Do not seek good things outside yourself; seek them within yourself, or you will not find them. For this reason, God brings me here, sends me there; He shows me to men as poor, without authority, sick; He sends me to Gyara, leads me into prison. Not because He hates me—far from it! Who hates his best servant? Nor because He neglects me, for He does not neglect any of the smallest things. But He is training me, and making use of me as a witness to others. Appointed to such a service, do I still care where I am, or with whom, or what they say about me? Am I not wholly stretched out toward God and His commands?\n\nHave these things always in hand. If you do, you will never need one to comfort you. For shame consists not in having nothing to eat, but in not having reason sufficient for fearlessness and freedom from pain.",
    "notes": "This discourse is a masterclass in the Stoic discipline of Assent and Desire, specifically focusing on 'Cosmic Citizenship' and the transient nature of externals.\n\n1.  **The Cosmic City & Sympatheia:** Epictetus argues that our local attachments (to Athens, Rome, or specific people) are a form of slavery. The true Stoic is a citizen of the Cosmos (Cosmopolitanism). Just as a soldier accepts his posting whether it be guard duty or the front lines, we must accept our station in life—be it exile, poverty, or death—as an assignment from the Divine Commander (Zeus/Nature).\n\n2.  **The Nature of Affection:** Epictetus redefines 'affection' (philostorgia). True affection is not shared misery (grieving because another grieves) but rational benevolence. If your love for someone makes you miserable or dependent, it is not love but enslavement to an external. The example of Odysseus is paramount: he loved his family but did not let his longing paralyze his ability to act virtuously in the present moment.\n\n3.  **The Fig in Winter:** This is one of Epictetus's most famous analogies for 'timing' and acceptance. To desire a friend who is absent, or a life that is past, is as irrational as demanding a summer fruit in the dead of winter. It violates the laws of nature. We must align our will with reality as it is *now*.\n\n4.  **Memento Mori as Practical Technique:** He offers a specific exercise: when you kiss your child or friend, remind yourself they are mortal ('like a pot or glass'). This is not to reduce love, but to shock the mind out of the false impression of permanence, thereby preventing devastating grief when the inevitable separation occurs.\n\n5.  **Ill-omened Words:** He deconstructs the superstition of 'bad omens.' Death and change are natural processes (like harvesting grain). Calling them 'evil' is a judgment we add, not a property of the events themselves.",

How do you feel when you recall your victories compared to your failures? If possible, recover even those positions from which you slipped away. For we must not shrink from the greatest of all contests just because we are struggling, but we must be willing to take blows. This contest is not for wrestling or the pancratium, where the winner may be a man of little worth and the loser may be lucky or miserable regardless; no, this contest is for good fortune and happiness itself. What then? Even if we give up here, no one prevents us from competing again. We do not need to wait another four years for the next Olympics! Rather, as soon as you have recovered yourself and restored your resolve, you are free to compete. And if you give up again, you can return again; and if you win even once, you are like one who never gave up. Only do not begin to do this out of habit, accepting defeat gladly. Do not become like a bad athlete who is beaten all around the circuit, or like quails that flee the cage. You say, 'I am defeated by the impression of a beautiful girl. What of it? Was I not defeated the day before yesterday?' or 'I have an impulse to disparage someone. Did I not disparage someone the other day?' You speak to us as if you had walked away unharmed! It is as if a man, whose doctor forbade him to bathe, should say, 'But did I not bathe the other day?' Come now, when you bathed, what did you suffer? Did you not have a fever? Did your head not ache? And you—when you disparaged someone earlier, did you not perform the work of a malicious person? Did you not act like a trifler? Did you not feed this habit of yours by adding corresponding actions to it? When you were defeated by the girl, did you depart unharmed? Why then do you mention 'the other day'? You ought, I think, to remember these things as slaves remember the whip, so as to abstain from the same faults. But it is not the same; for the slave, pain creates memory. But for you, in the case of your errors, what pain is there? What penalty? For when did you ever accustom yourself to flee from acting badly as if it were a true evil?",
    "notes": "Epictetus here addresses the resilience required for moral progress (prokopē). He frames the Stoic life as the 'Greatest Contest'—superior to the Olympics because the prize is not a wreath, but Eudaimonia (flourishing/happiness), and the arena is always open. The central lesson is that failure is not permanent; one can always 'restart' the contest immediately after a stumble without waiting. However, he issues a stern warning against the 'habit of defeat.' He attacks the student's tendency to rationalize current vices by pointing to past failures (e.g., 'I failed yesterday, so failing today is nothing new'). Epictetus counters this by explaining that vice leaves a wound on the character (hexis) just as a fever harms the body. The difficulty lies in the fact that moral error does not inflict immediate physical pain (unlike a slave being whipped), making it harder for the untrained mind to recognize the damage being done to the soul and to learn from it.",

    "english": "To those who fear want: Are you not ashamed to be more cowardly and ignoble than runaway slaves? How do they leave their masters when they flee? On what estates do they rely, on what servants? Do they not steal just a little for the first few days, and then afterwards journey through land or sea, devising one method after another to sustain themselves? And what runaway slave ever died of hunger? But you—you tremble lest the necessities fail you, and you lie awake at night. Wretched man! Are you so blind that you do not see the road to which the want of necessities leads? Where does it lead? To the same place that fever leads, or a falling stone—to death. 'Yes, but my wife and children will starve.' What then? Does their hunger lead to some other place? Is not the descent the same? Is not the world below the same? Will you not, then, have the courage to look upon that place to which even the wealthiest, and those who have held the greatest offices, and kings and tyrants themselves must descend? You will descend hungry, perhaps, while they will descend bursting from indigestion and drunkenness.\n\nHave you ever seen a beggar who was not an old man? Or one who was not extremely aged? Yet, chilling in the night and lying on the ground, eating only what is barely necessary, they approach a state where they cannot even die. But you, a sound man with hands and feet, are you so afraid of hunger? Can you not draw water, nor write, nor tutor, nor guard a door? 'But it is shameful to be reduced to such necessity.' Learn first what things are shameful, and then tell us you are a philosopher. But at present, do not let anyone else call you one; endure it if they do. Is that shameful to you which is not your own act, of which you are not the cause, which has come upon you by accident, like a headache or a fever? If your parents were poor, or if they were rich but left their inheritance to others, or if they are living but give you nothing, are these things shameful to you? Is this what you learned from the philosophers? Did you never hear that what is shameful is blameworthy, and what is blameworthy is deserving of blame? Whom have you blamed for this? Your father? Is it in your power to correct him? Is that given to you? What then? Must you desire what is not given, or be ashamed when you do not obtain it?\n\nAccustom yourself, therefore, as a philosopher, to look to others and not to hope for anything from yourself. Go ahead, groan and moan and eat in fear lest you have no food tomorrow! Tremble about your poor slaves, lest they steal, run away, or die. Live in this manner and never cease—you who have approached philosophy in name only and have disgraced its principles as far as you could, showing them to be useless and unprofitable to those who adopt them. You have never desired constancy, tranquility, or freedom from passion. You have attended to none of these, but only to syllogisms. You have never tested any of these impressions on yourself: 'Am I able to bear this, or am I not? What remains for me to do?'\n\nShow me what you are guarding, what you are measuring, or what you are weighing! Then show me the balance or the bushel. How long will you measure dust? You ought not to prove these things, but rather prove the things that make men happy, that make their affairs proceed as they wish, so that they need not blame anyone or accuse anyone, but yield to the administration of the universe. Show me these things! 'See,' you say, 'I will analyze syllogisms for you.' This is why you are now paying the penalty for neglecting philosophy: you tremble at the thought of hunger, or so you think. But it is not hunger you fear; you fear you will not have a cook, you will not have someone to buy your fish, someone to put on your shoes, someone to dress you, others to rub you down, others to follow you, so that when you have undressed in the bath and stretched yourself out like those who represent the crucified, you may be rubbed here and there, and the rubber may stand over you and say, 'Turn him over, give me his side, take hold of his head, present his shoulder'; and then when you leave the bath and go home, you cry out, 'Does no one bring me something to eat?' and then, 'Take away the tables, wipe them.'\n\nIf this is what you wish to have, you will have it nowhere, and you will live in fear. But if you wish for what you can have everywhere, you will live with confidence. confidence in what? In the only thing in which one can confide: in what is faithful, unhindered, and cannot be taken away—that is, in your own moral purpose (prohairesis). Why have you made yourself so useless and unprofitable that no one is willing to receive you into his house, no one to take care of you? If a useful vessel is thrown out, everyone finds it and picks it up and thinks it a gain; but no one will pick you up; everyone thinks you a loss. Can you not even perform the service of a dog or a rooster? Why then do you wish to live any longer if you are such a man?\n\nDoes a good man fear that food will fail him? It does not fail the blind; it does not fail the lame; will it fail a good man? It does not fail the soldier, or the laborer, or the shoemaker; will it fail the good man? Does God so neglect his own creatures, his servants, his witnesses, whom alone he uses as examples to the uninstructed, to show that he exists and governs the universe well, and does not neglect human affairs, and that to a good man there is no evil, neither when he is living nor when he is dead? 'But what if he does not provide food?' What else than that, like a good general, he has signaled the recall? I obey, I follow, praising my Commander and singing hymns to his deeds. For I came when it pleased him, and I depart when it pleases him; and while I lived, it was my work to sing praises to God, both by myself, and to one, and to many.\n\nHe does not provide me with many things, nor with abundance; he does not wish me to live luxuriously; for he did not provide abundantly for Hercules, his own son, but another reigned over Argos and Mycenae, while Hercules obeyed orders and labored and was exercised. And Eurystheus was what he was—neither king of Argos nor of Mycenae, for he was not even king of himself—but Hercules was ruler and leader of the whole earth and sea, the purger of injustice and lawlessness, and the introducer of justice and holiness; and he did these things naked and alone. And when Odysseus was cast away shipwrecked, did his want abase him? Did it break his spirit? Nay, but how did he go to the maidens to ask for necessities, which it is thought most shameful to beg from another? 'Like a lion bred in the mountains.' Trusting in what? Not in reputation, nor in wealth, nor in offices, but in his own strength—that is, in his judgments about things that are within our power and those that are not. For these alone are what make men free, what make them unhindered, what raise the neck of those who are humbled, what make them look with steady eyes upon the rich and upon tyrants. And this was the gift of the philosopher. But you—will you not go forth with confidence, but trembling about your clothes and your silver vessels? Wretched man! Have you thus wasted all your time until now?\n\n'What then, if I become sick?' You will be sick well. 'Who will nurse me?' God, and your friends. 'I shall lie on a hard bed.' But you will lie like a man. 'I shall not have a suitable house.' Then you will be sick in an unsuitable one. 'Who will prepare my food?' Those who prepare it for others; you will be sick like Manes (a slave). 'But what is the end of the sickness?' Any other than death? Do you not realize, then, that the chief source of all human evils, and of baseness and cowardice, is not death, but rather the fear of death? Against this fear, then, I exercise myself; to this let all your reasoning, your exercises, your reading tend; and you will know that only in this way are men made free.",
    "notes": "1. **The Illusion of Indispensability vs. Real Utility:** Epictetus attacks the student's vanity. The student fears 'starving,' but actually fears the loss of luxury (servants, baths, status). A true Stoic makes themselves useful to the cosmos and society through virtue. If you are 'useless' (unable to serve even as a watchdog), you have failed your purpose. If you are virtuous, you are as resilient as a runaway slave or a beggar, who survives despite having nothing.\n\n2. **The Definition of Shame:** Shame is misapplied to external circumstances (poverty, lack of inheritance). True shame belongs only to moral failure—actions that are 'up to us' (prohairesis) which violate reason. Being poor is an indifferent; being a coward about poverty is a vice.\n\n3. **The Military Metaphor of Life:** God is the General. He provides rations (life/resources). When the rations stop, it is not a tragedy; it is the 'recall signal' (death). The Stoic soldier obeys the recall efficiently and with gratitude for the time served, rather than complaining about the end of the deployment.\n\n4. **The Ultimate Fear:** The lecture concludes by identifying the root of the anxiety: the fear of death. The fear of poverty is merely a proxy for the fear of dying. If one conquers the fear of death (the inevitable end), all lesser fears (hunger, sickness, discomfort) vanish. Hercules and Odysseus are cited as exemplars of this self-reliance and fearlessness, possessing internal kingship regardless of external raggedness.",

— οὐδὲ εἷς. — ἔχομεν οὖν τινα τῶν φαύλων ἄλυπον, ἄφοβον, ἀπερίπτωτον, ἀναπότευκτον; — οὐδένα. — οὐκ ἄρα οὐδὲ ἐλεύθερον. ταῦτα ἄν τις ἀκούσῃ δισύπατος, ἂν μὲν προσθῇς ὅτι ἀλλὰ σύ γε σοφὸς εἶ, οὐδὲν πρὸς σὲ ταῦτα, ἂν δʼ αὐτῷ τὰς ἀληθείας εἴπῃς ὅτι τῶν τρὶς πεπραμένων οὐδὲν διαφέρεις πρὸς τὸ μὴ καὶ αὐτὸς δοῦλος εἶναι, πῶς γάρ, ἐγὼ δοῦλός εἰμι; ὁ πατὴρ ἐλεύθερος, ἡ μήτηρ ἐλευθέρα, οὗ ὠνὴν οὐδεὶς ἔχει· ἀλλὰ καὶ συγκλητικός εἰμι καὶ Καίσαρος φίλος καὶ ὑπάτευκα καὶ δούλους πολλοὺς ἔχω. πρῶτον μέν, ὦ βέλτιστε συγκλητικέ, τάχα σου καὶ ὁ πατὴρ τὴν αὐτὴν δουλείαν δοῦλος ἦν καὶ ἡ μήτηρ καὶ ὁ πάππος καὶ ἐφεξῆς πάντες οἱ πρόγονοι. εἰ δὲ δὴ καὶ τὰ μάλιστα ἦσαν ἐλεύθεροι, τί τοῦτο πρὸς σέ; τί γάρ, εἰ ἐκεῖνοι μὲν γενναῖοι ἦσαν, σὺ δʼ ἀγεννής; ἐκεῖνοι μὲν ἄφοβοι, σὺ δὲ δειλός; ἐκεῖνοι μὲν ἐγκρατεῖς, σὺ δʼ ἀκόλαστος; καὶ τί, φησί, τοῦτο πρὸς τὸ δοῦλον εἶναι;— οὐδέν σοι φαίνεται εἶναι τὸ ἄκοντά τι ποιεῖν, τὸ ἀναγκαζόμενον, τὸ στένοντα πρὸς τὸ δοῦλον εἶναι; — τοῦτο μὲν ἔστω, φησίν. ἀλλὰ τίς με δύναται ἀναγκάσαι, εἰ μὴ ὁ πάντων κύριος Καῖσαρ; — οὐκοῦν ἕνα μὲν δεσπότην σαυτοῦ καὶ σὺ αὐτὸς ὡμολόγησας. ὅτι δὲ πάντων, ὡς λέγεις, κοινός ἐστιν, μηδέν σε τοῦτο παραμυθείσθω, ἀλλὰ γίγνωσκε, ὅτι ἐκ μεγάλης οἰκίας δοῦλος εἶ. οὕτως καὶ Νικοπολῖται ἐπιβοᾶν εἰώθασι νὴ τὴν Καίσαρος τύχην, ἐλεύθεροί ἐσμεν. ὅμως δʼ, ἐάν σοι δοκῇ, τὸν μὲν Καίσαρα πρὸς τὸ παρὸν ἀφῶμεν, ἐκεῖνο δέ μοι εἰπέ· οὐδέποτʼ ἠράσθης τινός; οὐ παιδισκαρίου, οὐ παιδαρίου, οὐ δούλου, οὐκ ἐλευθέρου; — τί οὖν τοῦτο πρὸς τὸ δοῦλον εἶναι ἢ ἐλεύθερον; — οὐδέποθʼ ὑπὸ τῆς ἐρωμένης ἐπετάγης οὐδὲν ὧν οὐκ ἤθελες; οὐδέποτέ σου τὸ δουλάριον ἐκολάκευσας; οὐδέποτʼ αὐτοῦ τοὺς πόδας κατεφίλησας; καίτοι τοῦ Καίσαρος ἄν σέ τις ἀναγκάσῃ, ὕβριν αὐτὸ ἡγῇ καὶ ὑπερβολὴν τυραννίδος. τί οὖν ἄλλο ἐστὶ δουλεία; νυκτὸς οὐδέποτʼ ἀπῆλθες, ὅπου οὐκ ἤθελες; ἀνάλωσας, ὅσα οὐκ ἤθελες; εἶπάς τινα οἰμώζων καὶ στένων, ἠνέσχου λοιδορούμενος, ἀποκλειόμενος; ἀλλʼ εἰ σὺ αἰσχύνῃ τὰ σαυτοῦ ὁμολογεῖν, ὅρα ἃ λέγει καὶ ποιεῖ ὁ Θρασωνίδης, ὃς τοσαῦτα στρατευσάμενος, ὅσα τάχα οὐδὲ σύ, πρῶτον μὲν ἐξελήλυθε νυκτός, ὅτε ὁ Γέτας οὐ τολμᾷ ἐξελθεῖν, ἀλλʼ εἰ προσηναγκάζετο ὑπʼ αὐτοῦ, πόλλʼ ἂν ἐπικραυγάσας καὶ τὴν πικρὰν δουλείαν ἀπολοφυράμενος ἐξῆλθεν. εἶτα, τί λέγει; τάλας, ὅς γε καὶ παιδισκαρίου δοῦλος εἶ καὶ παιδισκαρίου εὐτελοῦς. τί οὖν ἔτι σαυτὸν ἐλεύθερον λέγεις; τί δὲ προφέρεις σου τὰς στρατείας; εἶτα ξίφος αἰτεῖ καὶ πρὸς τὸν ὑπʼ εὐνοίας μὴ διδόντα χαλεπαίνει ν μηδʼ ἐπιθυμεῖν ἢ φοβεῖσθαι οὔτʼ ἐλευθερίαν σκέψαι δʼ ἐπὶ τῶν ζῴων, πῶς χρώμεθα τῇ ἐννοίᾳ τῆς ἐλευθερίας. λέοντας τρέφουσιν ἡμέρους ἐγκλείσαντες καὶ σιτίζουσι καὶ κομίζουσιν ἔνιοι μεθʼ αὑτῶν. καὶ τίς ἐρεῖ τοῦτον τὸν λέοντα ἐλεύθερον; οὐχὶ δʼ ὅσῳ μαλακώτερον διεξάγει, τοσούτῳ δουλικώτερον; τίς δʼ ἂν λέων αἴσθησιν καὶ λογισμὸν λαβὼν βούλοιτο τούτων τις εἶναι τῶν λεόντων; ἄγε, τὰ δὲ πτηνὰ ταῦτα ὅταν ληφθῇ καὶ ἐγκεκλειμένα τρέφηται, οἷα πάσχει ζητοῦντα ἐκφυγεῖν; καὶ ἔνιά γε αὐτῶν λιμῷ διαφθείρεται μᾶλλον ἢ ὑπομένει τὴν τοιαύτην διεξαγωγήν, ὅσα δʼ οὖν διασῴζεται, μόγις καὶ χαλεπῶς καὶ φθίνοντα, κἂν ὅλως εὕρῃ τι παρεῳγμένον, ἐξεπήδησεν. οὕτως ὀρέγεται τῆς φυσικῆς ἐλευθερίας καὶ τοῦ αὐτόνομα καὶ ἀκώλυτα εἶναι. καὶ τί σοι κακόν ἐστιν ἐνταῦθα; οἷα λέγεις; πέτεσθαι πέφυκα ὅπου θέλω, ὕπαιθρον διάγειν, ᾁδειν ὅταν θέλω· σύ με πάντων τούτων ἀφαιρῇ καὶ λέγεις τί σοι κακόν ἐστιν; διὰ τοῦτο ἐκεῖνα μόνα ἐροῦμεν ἐλεύθερα, ὅσα τὴν ἅλωσιν οὐ φέρει, ἀλλʼ ἅμα τε ἑάλω καὶ ἀποθανόντα διέφυγεν. οὕτως καὶ Διογένης που λέγει μίαν εἶναι μηχανὴν πρὸς ἐλευθερίαν τὸ εὐκόλως ἀποθνῄσκειν, καὶ τῷ Περσῶν βασιλεῖ γράφει ὅτι τὴν Ἀθηναίων πόλιν καταδουλώσασθαι οὐ δύνασαι· οὐ μᾶλλον, ἢ τοὺς ἰχθύας. πῶς; οὐ γὰρ λήψομαι αὐτούς; ἂν λάβῃς, εὐθὺς ἀπολιπόντες σε οἰχήσονται, καθάπερ οἱ ἰχθύες. τοῦτʼ ἔστιν ἐλευθέρου ἀνδρὸς φωνὴ σπουδῇ ἐξητακότος τὸ πρᾶγμα καὶ ὥσπερ εἰκὸς εὑρηκότος. ἂν δʼ ἀλλαχοῦ ζητῇς ἢ ὅπου ἐστίν, τί θαυμαστόν, εἰ οὐδέποτε αὐτὸ εὑρίσκεις; ὁ δοῦλος εὐθὺς εὔχεται ἀφεθῆναι ἐλεύθερος. διὰ τί; δοκεῖτε, ὅτι τοῖς εἰκοστώναις ἐπιθυμεῖ δοῦναι ἀργύριον; οὔ· ἀλλʼ ὅτι φαντάζεται μέχρι νῦν διὰ τὸ μὴ τετυχηκέναι τούτου ἐμποδίζεσθαι καὶ δυσροεῖν. ἂν ἀφεθῶ, εὐθὺς πᾶσα εὔροια, οὐδενὸς ἐπιστρέφομαι, πᾶσιν ὡς ἴσος καὶ ὅμοιος λαλῶ, πορεύομαι ὅπου θέλω, ἔρχομαι ὅθεν θέλω καὶ ὅπου θέλω. εἶτα ἀπηλευθέρωται καὶ εὐθὺς μὲν οὐκ ἔχων, ποῖ φάγῃ, ζητεῖ, τίνα κολακεύσῃ, παρὰ τίνι δειπνήσῃ· εἶτα ἢ ἐργάζεται τῷ σώματι καὶ πάσχει τὰ δεινότατα κἂν σχῇ τινα φάτνην, ἐμπέπτωκεν εἰς δουλείαν πολὺ τῆς προτέρας χαλεπω τέραν ἢ καὶ εὐπορήσας ἄνθρωπος ἀπειρόκαλος πεφίληκε παιδισκάριον καὶ δυστυχῶν ἀνακλαίεται καὶ τὴν δουλείαν ποθεῖ. τί γάρ μοι κακὸν ἦν; ἄλλος μʼ ἐνέδυεν, ἄλλος μʼ ὑπέδει, ἄλλος ἔτρεφεν, ἄλλος ἐνοσοκόμει, ὀλίγα αὐτῷ ὑπηρέτουν. νῦν δὲ τάλας οἷα πάσχω πλείοσι δουλεύων ἀνθʼ ἑνός; ὅμως δʼ ἐὰν δακτυλίους, λάβω, τότε γʼ εὐρούστατα διάξω καὶ εὐδαιμονέστατα. εἶτά φησιν ἂν μὲν στρατεύσωμαι, ἀπηλλάγην πάντων τῶν κακῶν. εἶθʼ ὅταν αὐτὸν τὸν κολοφῶνα ἐπιθῇ καὶ γένηται συγκλητικός, τότε γίνεται δοῦλος εἰς σύλλογον ἐρχόμενος, τότε τὴν καλλίστην καὶ λιπαρωτάτην δουλείαν δουλεύει. ἵνα μὴ μωρὸς ᾖ, ἀλλʼ ἵνα μάθῃ, ἃ ἔλεγεν ὁ Σωκράτης, τί ἐστι τῶν ὄντων ἕκαστον, καὶ μὴ εἰκῇ τὰς προλήψεις ἐφαρμόζῃ ταῖς ἐπὶ μέρους οὐσίαις. τοῦτο γάρ ἐστι τὸ αἴτιον τοῖς ἀνθρώποις πάντων τῶν κακῶν, τὸ τὰς προλήψεις τὰς κοινὰς μὴ δύνασθαι ἐφαρμόζειν. τοῖς ἐπὶ μέρους. ἡμεῖς δʼ ἄλλοι ἄλλο οἰόμεθα. ὁ μὲν ὅτι νοσεῖ. οὐδαμῶς, ἀλλʼ ὅτι τὰς προλήψεις οὐκ ἐφαρμόζει. ὁ δʼ ὅτι πτωχός ἐστιν, ὁ δʼ ὅτι πατέρα χαλεπὸν ἔχει ἢ μητέρα, τῷ δʼ ὅτι ὁ Καῖσαρ οὐχ ἵλεώς ἐστιν. τοῦτο δʼ ἐστὶν ἓν καὶ μόνον τὸ τὰς προλήψεις ἐφαρμόζειν μὴ εἰδέναι. ἐπεὶ τίς οὐκ ἔχει κακοῦ πρόληψιν, ὅτι βλαβερόν ἐστιν, ὅτι φευκτόν ἐστιν, ὅτι παντὶ τρόπῳ ἀποικονόμητόν ἐστιν; πρόληψις προλήψει οὐ μάχεται, ἀλλʼ ὅταν ἔλθῃ ἐπὶ τὸ ἐφαρμόζειν. τί οὖν τὸ κακόν ἐστι τοῦτο καὶ βλαβερὸν καὶ φευκτόν; λέγει τὸ Καίσαρος μὴ εἶναι φίλον· ἀπῆλθεν, ἀπέ σ τί γάρ ἐστιν, ὃ ζητεῖ πᾶς ἄνθρωπος; εὐσταθῆσαι, εὐδαιμονῆσαι, πάντα ὡς θέλει ποιεῖν, μὴ κωλύεσθαι, μὴ ἀναγκάζεσθαι. ὅταν οὖν γένηται Καίσαρος φίλος, πέπαυται κωλυόμενος, πέπαυται ἀναγκαζόμενος, εὐσταθεῖ, εὐροεῖ; τίνος πυθώμεθα; τίνα ἔχομεν ἀξιοπιστότερον ἢ αὐτὸν τοῦτον τὸν γεγονότα φίλον; ἐλθὲ εἰς τὸ μέσον καὶ εἰπὲ ἡμῖν, πότε ἀταραχώτερον ἐκάθευδες, νῦν ἢ πρὶν γενέσθαι φίλος τοῦ Καίσαρος; εὐθὺς ἀκούεις ὅτι παῦσαι, τοὺς θεούς σοι, ἐμπαίζων μου τῇ τύχῃ· οὐκ οἶδας, οἷα πάσχω τάλας· οὐδʼ ὕπνος ἐπέρχεταί μοι, ἀλλʼ ἄλλος ἐλθὼν λέγει, ὅτι ἤδη ἐγρηγορεῖ, ἤδη πρόεισιν· εἶτα ταραχαί, εἶτα φροντίδες. ἄγε, ἐδείπνεις δὲ πότε εὐαρεστότερον, νῦν ἢ πρότερον; ἄκουσον αὐτοῦ καὶ περὶ τούτων τί λέγει· ὅτι, ἂν μὲν μὴ κληθῇ, ὀδυνᾶται, ἂν δὲ κληθῇ, ὡς δοῦλος παρὰ κυρίῳ δειπνεῖ μεταξὺ προσέχων, μή τι μωρὸν εἴπῃ ἢ ποιήσῃ. καὶ τί δοκεῖς φοβεῖται; μὴ μαστιγωθῇ ὡς δοῦλος; πόθεν αὐτῷ οὕτως καλῶς; ἀλλʼ ὡς πρέπει τηλικοῦτον ἄνδρα, Καίσαρος φίλον, μὴ ἀπολέσῃ τὸν τράχηλον. ἐλούου δὲ πότʼ ἀταραχώτερον; ἐγυμνάζου δὲ πότε σχολαίτερον; τὸ σύνολον ποῖον μᾶλλον ἤθελες βίον βιοῦν, τὸν νῦν ἢ τὸν τότε; ὀμόσαι δύναμαι, ὅτι οὐδεὶς οὕτως ἐστὶν ἀναίσθητος ἢ ἀναλήθης, μὴ ἀποδύρασθαι τὰς αὑτοῦ συμφοράς, ὅσῳ ἂν ᾖ φίλτερος. ὅταν οὖν μήτε οἱ βασιλεῖς λεγόμενοι ζῶσιν ὡς θέλουσι μήθʼ οἱ φίλοι τῶν βασιλέων, τίνες ἔτι εἰσὶν ἐλεύθεροι; — ζήτει καὶ εὑρήσεις. ἔχεις γὰρ ἀφορμὰς παρὰ τῆς φύσεως πρὸς εὕρεσιν τῆς ἀληθείας. εἰ δʼ αὐτὸς οὐχ οἷός τε εἶ κατὰ ταύτας ψιλὰς πορευόμενος εὑρεῖν τὸ ἑξῆς, ἄκουσον παρὰ τῶν ἐζητηκότων. τί λέγουσιν; ἀγαθόν σοι δοκεῖ ἡ ἐλευθερία; — τὸ μέγιστον. — δύναται οὖν τις τοῦ μεγίστου ἀγαθοῦ τυγχάνων κακοδαιμονεῖν ἢ κακῶς πράσσειν; — οὔ. — ὅσους οὖν ἂν ἴδῃς κακοδαιμονοῦντας, δυσροοῦντας, πενθοῦντας, ἀποφαίνου θαρρῶν μὴ εἶναι ἐλευθέρους. — ἀποφαίνομαι. — οὐκοῦν ἀπὸ μὲν ὠνῆς καὶ πράσεως καὶ τῆς τοιαύτης ἐν κτήσει κατατάξεως ἤδη ἀποκεχωρήκαμεν. εἰ γὰρ ὀρθῶς ὡμολόγησας ταῦτα, ἄν τε μέγας βασιλεὺς κακοδαιμονῇ, οὐκ ἂν ἐλεύθερος, ἄν τε μικρὸς ἄν θʼ ὑπατικὸς ἄν τε δισύπατος. — ἔστω. ἔτι οὖν ἀπόκριναί μοι κἀκεῖνο· δοκεῖ σοι μέγα τι εἶναι καὶ γενναῖον ἡ ἐλευθερία καὶ ἀξιόλογον; — πῶς γὰρ οὔ; — ἔστιν οὖν τυγχάνοντά τινος οὕτως μεγάλου καὶ ἀξιολόγου καὶ γενναίου ταπεινὸν εἶναι; — οὐκ ἔστιν. — ὅταν οὖν ἴδῃς τινὰ ὑποπεπτωκότα ἑτέρῳ ἢ κολακεύοντα παρὰ τὸ φαινόμενον αὐτῷ, λέγε καὶ τοῦτον θαρρῶν μὴ εἶναι ἐλεύθερον· καὶ μὴ μόνον, ἂν δειπναρίου ἕνεκα αὐτὸ ποιῇ, ἀλλὰ κἂν ἐπαρχίας ἕνεκα κἂν ὑπατείας. ἀλλʼ ἐκείνους μὲν μικροδούλους λέγε τοὺς μικρῶν τινων ἕνεκα ταῦτα ποιοῦντας, τούτους δʼ, ὡς εἰσὶν ἄξιοι, μεγαλοδούλους. — ἔστω καὶ ταῦτα. — δοκεῖ δέ σοι ἡ ἐλευθερία αὐτεξούσιόν τι εἶναι καὶ αὐτόνομον; — πῶς γὰρ οὔ; — ὅντινα οὖν ἐπʼ ἄλλῳ κωλῦσαι ἔστι καὶ ἀναγκάσαι, θαρρῶν λέγε μὴ εἶναι ἐλεύθερον. καὶ μή μοι πάππους αὐτοῦ καὶ προπάππους βλέπε καὶ ὠνὴν ζήτει καὶ πρᾶσιν, ἀλλʼ ἂν ἀκούσῃς λέγοντος ἔσωθεν καὶ ἐκ πάθους κύριε, τάλας ἐγώ, οἷα πάσχω, ἂν οὖν μηδὲν τούτων ποιῇ, μήπω εἴπῃς ἐλεύθερον, ἀλλὰ τὰ δόγματα αὐτοῦ κατάμαθε, μή τι ἀναγκαστά, μή τι κωλυτικά, μή τι δυσροητικά· κἂν εὕρῃς τοιοῦτον, λέγε δοῦλον ἀνοχὰς ἔχοντα ἐν Σατο υ — τίς ἥξει; — πᾶς ὃς ἂν ἐξουσίαν ἔχῃ τῶν ὑπʼ αὐτοῦ τινος θελομένων πρὸς τὸ περιποιῆσαι ταῦτα ἢ ἀφελέσθαι. — οὕτως οὖν πολλοὺς κυρίους ἔχομεν; — οὕτως. τὰ γὰρ πράγματα προτέρους τούτων κυρίους ἔχομεν· ἐκεῖνα δὲ πολλά ἐστιν. διὰ ταῦτα ἀνάγκη καὶ τοὺς τούτων τινὸς ἔχοντας ἐξουσίαν κυρίους εἶναι· ἐπεί τοι οὐδεὶς αὐτὸν τὸν Καίσαρα φοβεῖται, ἀλλὰ θάνατον, φυγήν, ἀφαίρεσιν τῶν ὄντων, φυλακήν, ἀτιμίαν. οὐδὲ φιλεῖ τις τὸν Καίσαρα, ἂν μή τι ᾖ πολλοῦ ἄξιος, ἀλλὰ πλοῦτον φιλοῦμεν, δημαρχίαν, στρατηγίαν, ὑπατείαν. ὅταν ταῦτα φιλῶμεν καὶ μισῶμεν καὶ φοβώμεθα, ἀνάγκη τοὺς ἐξουσίαν αὐτῶν ἔχοντας κυρίους ἡμῶν εἶναι. διὰ τοῦτο καὶ ὡς θεοὺς αὐτοὺς προσκυνοῦμεν· ἐννοοῦμεν γάρ, ὅτι τὸ ἔχον ἐξουσίαν τῆς μεγίστης ὠφελείας θεῖόν ἐστιν, εἶθʼ ὑποτάσσομεν κακῶς οὗτος δʼ ἔχει τῆς μεγίστης ὠφελείας· θεῖόν ἐστιν. εἶθʼ ὑποτάσσομεν κακῶς, οὗτος δʼ ἔχει τί οὖν ἐστι τὸ ποιοῦν ἀκώλυτον τὸν ἄνθρωπον καὶ αὐτεξούσιον; πλοῦτος γὰρ οὐ ποιεῖ οὐδʼ ὑπατεία οὐδʼ ἐπαρχία οὐδὲ βασιλεία, ἀλλὰ δεῖ τι ἄλλο εὑρεθῆναι. τί οὖν ἐστι τὸ ἐν τῷ γράφειν ἀκώλυτον ποιοῦν καὶ ἀπαραπόδιστον; — ἡ ἐπιστήμη τοῦ γράφειν. — τί δʼ ἐν τῷ κιθαρίζειν; — ἡ ἐπιστήμη τοῦ κιθαρίζειν. — οὐκοῦν καὶ ἐν τῷ βιοῦν ἡ ἐπιστήμη τοῦ βιοῦν. ὡς μὲν οὖν ἁπλῶς, ἀκήκοας· σκέψαι δʼ αὐτὸ καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἐπὶ μέρους. τὸν ἐφιέμενόν τινος τῶν ἐπʼ ἄλλοις ὄντων ἐνδέχεται ἀκώλυτον εἶναι; — οὔ. — ἐνδέχεται ἀπαραπόδιστον; — οὔ. — οὐκοῦν οὐδʼ ἐλεύθερον. ὅρα οὖν· πότερον οὐδὲν ἔχομεν, ὃ ἐφʼ ἡμῖν μόνοις ἐστίν, ἢ πάντα ἢ τὰ μὲν ἐφʼ ἡμῖν ἐστιν, τὰ δʼ ἐπʼ ἄλλοις; — πῶς λέγεις; — τὸ σῶμα ὅταν θέλῃς ὁλόκληρον εἶναι, ἐπὶ σοί ἐστιν ἢ οὔ; — οὐκ ἐπʼ ἐμοί. — ὅταν δʼ ὑγιαίνειν; — οὐδὲ τοῦτο. — ὅταν δὲ καλὸν εἶναι; — οὐδὲ τοῦτο. — ζῆν δὲ καὶ ἀποθανεῖν; — οὐδὲ τοῦτο. — οὐκοῦν τὸ μὲν σῶμα ἀλλότριον, ὑπεύθυνον παντὸς τοῦ ἰσχυροτέρου. — ἔστω. — τὸν ἀγρὸν δʼ ἐπὶ σοί ἐστιν ἔχειν, ὅταν θέλῃς καὶ ἐφʼ ὅσον θέλεις καὶ οἷον θέλεις; — οὔ. — τὰ δὲ δουλάρια; — οὔ. — τὰ δʼ ἱμάτια; — οὔ. — τὸ δὲ οἰκίδιον; — οὔ. — τοὺς δʼ ἵππους; — τούτων μὲν οὐδέν. — ἂν δὲ τὰ τέκνα σου ζῆν θέλῃς ἐξ ἅπαντος ἢ τὴν γυναῖκα ἢ τὸν ἀδελφὸν ἢ τοὺς φίλους, ἐπὶ σοί ἐστιν; — οὐδὲ ταῦτα. πότερον οὖν οὐδὲν ἔχεις αὐτεξούσιον, ὃ ἐπὶ μόνῳ ἐστὶ σοί, ἢ ἔχεις τι τοιοῦτον; — οὐκ οἶδα. — ὅρα οὖν οὕτως καὶ σκέψαι αὐτό. μή τις δύναταί σε ποιῆσαι συγκαταθέσθαι τῷ ψεύδει; — οὐδείς. — οὐκοῦν ἐν μὲν τῷ συγκαταθετικῷ τόπῳ ἀκώλυτος εἶ καὶ ἀνεμπόδιστος. — ἔστω. — ἄγε, ὁρμῆσαι δέ σε ἐφʼ ὃ μὴ θέλεις τις δύναται ἀναγκάσαι; — δύναται. ὅταν γάρ μοι θάνατον ἢ δεσμὰ ἀπειλῇ, ἀναγκάζει μʼ ὁρμῆσαι. — ἂν οὖν καταφρονῇς τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν καὶ τοῦ δεδέσθαι, ἔτι αὐτοῦ ἐπιστρέφῃ; — οὔ. — σὸν οὖν ἐστιν ἔργον τὸ καταφρονεῖν θανάτου ἢ οὐ σόν; — ἐμόν. — σὸν ἄρα ἐστὶ καὶ τὸ ὁρμῆσαι ἢ οὔ; — ἔστω ἐμόν. — τὸ δʼ ἀφορμῆσαι τίνος; σὸν καὶ τοῦτο. — τί οὖν, ἂν ἐμοῦ ὁρμήσαντος περιπατῆσαι ἐκεῖνός με κωλύσῃ; — τί σου κωλύσει; μή τι τὴν συγκατάθεσιν; — οὔ· ἀλλὰ τὸ σωμάτιον. — ναί, ὡς λίθον. — ἔστω· ἀλλʼ οὐκέτι ἐγὼ περιπατῶ. — τίς δέ σοι εἶπεν τὸ περιπατῆσαι σὸν ἔργον ἐστὶν ἀκώλυτον; — ἔστω καὶ ταῦτα. — ὀρέγεσθαι δέ σε οὗ μὴ θέλεις τις ἀναγκάσαι δύναται; — οὐδείς. — προθέσθαι δʼ ἢ ἐπιβαλέσθαι τις ἢ ἁπλῶς χρῆσθαι ταῖς προσπιπτούσαις φαντασίαις; — οὐδὲ τοῦτο· ἀλλὰ ὀρεγόμενόν με κωλύσει τυχεῖν οὗ ὀρέγομαι. — ἂν τῶν σῶν τινος ὀρέγῃ καὶ τῶν ἀκωλύτων, πῶς σε κωλύσει; — οὐδαμῶς. — τίς οὖν σοι λέγει, ὅτι ὁ τῶν ἀλλοτρίων ὀρεγόμενος ἀκώλυτός ἐστιν; Ὑγείας οὖν μὴ ὀρέγωμαι;— μηδαμῶς, μηδʼ ἄλλου ἀλλοτρίου μηδενός. ὃ γὰρ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐπὶ σοὶ παρασκευάσαι ἢ τηρῆσαι ὅτε θέλεις, τοῦτο ἀλλότριόν ἐστιν. μακρὰν ἀπʼ αὐτοῦ οὐ μόνον τὰς χεῖρας, ἀλλὰ πολὺ πρότερον τὴν ὄρεξιν· εἰ δὲ μή, παρέδωκας σαυτὸν δοῦλον, ὑπέθηκας τὸν τράχηλον, ἂν τι — μέρος ἐστὶ σόν, φύσει δὲ πηλός, κωλυτόν, ἀναγκαστόν, δοῦλον παντὸς τοῦ ἰσχυροτέρου. καὶ τί σοι λέγω χεῖρα; ὅλον τὸ σῶμα οὕτως ἔχειν σε δεῖ ὡς ὀνάριον ἐπισεσαγμένον, ἐφʼ ὅσον ἂν οἷόν τε ᾖ, ἐφʼ ὅσον ἂν διδῶται· ἂν δʼ ἀγγαρεία ᾖ καὶ στρατιώτης ἐπιλάβηται, ἄφες, μὴ ἀντίτεινε μηδὲ γόγγυζε. εἰ δὲ μή, πληγὰς λαβὼν οὐδὲν ἧττον ἀπολεῖς καὶ τὸ ὀνάριον. ὅταν δὲ πρὸς τὸ σῶμα οὕτως ἔχειν σε δέῃ, ὅρα, τί ἀπολείπεται περὶ τὰ ἄλλα, ὅσα τοῦ σώματος ἕνεκα παρασκευάζεται. ὅταν ἐκεῖνο ὀνάριον ᾖ, τἆλλα γίνεται χαλινάρια τοῦ ὀναρίου, σαγμάτια, ὑποδημάτια, κριθαί, χόρτος. ἄφες κἀκεῖνα, ἀπόλυε θᾶττον καὶ εὐκολώτερον ἢ τὸ ὀνάριον. καὶ ταύτην τὴν παρασκευὴν παρασκευασάμενος καὶ τὴν ἄσκησιν ἀσκήσας τὰ ἀλλότρια ἀπὸ τῶν ἰδίων διακρίνειν, τὰ κωλυτὰ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀκωλύτων, ταῦτα πρὸς σαυτὸν ἡγεῖσθαι, ἐκεῖνα μὴ πρὸς σαυτόν, ἐνταῦθα ἐπιστρόφως ἔχειν τὴν ὄρεξιν, ἐνταῦθα τὴν ἔκκλισιν, μή τι ἔτι φοβῇ τινα; — οὐδένα. — περὶ τίνος γὰρ φοβήσῃ; περὶ τῶν σεαυτοῦ, ὅπου σοι ἡ οὐσία τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ καὶ τοῦ κακοῦ; καὶ τίς τούτων ἐξουσίαν ἔχει; τίς ἀφελέσθαι αὐτὰ δύναται, τίς ἐμποδίσαι; οὐ μᾶλλον ἢ τὸν θεόν. ἀλλʼ ὑπὲρ τοῦ σώματος καὶ τῆς κτήσεως; ὑπὲρ τῶν ἀλλοτρίων; ὑπὲρ τῶν οὐδὲν πρὸς σέ; καὶ τί ἄλλο ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἐμελέτας ἢ διακρίνειν τὰ σὰ καὶ οὐ σά, τὰ ἐπὶ σοὶ καὶ οὐκ ἐπὶ σοί, τὰ κωλυτὰ καὶ ἀκώλυτα; τίνος δὲ ἕνεκα προσῆλθες τοῖς φιλοσόφοις; ἵνα μηδὲν ἧττον ἀτυχῇς καὶ δυστυχῇς; οὐκοῦν ἄφοβος μὲν οὕτως ἔσει καὶ ἀτάραχος. λύπη δὲ τί πρὸς σέ; ὧν γὰρ προσδοκωμένων φόβος γίνεται, καὶ λύπη παρόντων. ἐπιθυμήσεις δὲ τίνος ἔτι; τῶν μὲν γὰρ προαιρετικῶν ἅτε καλῶν ὄντων καὶ παρόντων σύμμετρον ἔχεις καὶ καθισταμένην τὴν ὄρεξιν, τῶν δʼ ἀπροαιρέτων οὐδενὸς ὀρέγῃ, ἵνα καὶ τόπον σχῇ τὸ ἄλογον ἐκεῖνο καὶ ὠστικὸν καὶ παρὰ τὰ μέτρα ἠπειγμένον; ὅταν οὖν πρὸς τὰ πράγματα οὕτως ἔχῃς, τίς ἔτι ἄνθρωπος δύναται φοβερὸς εἶναι; τί γὰρ ἔχει ἄνθρωπος ἀνθρώπῳ φοβερὸν ἢ ὀφθεὶς ἢ λαλήσας ἢ ὅλως συναναστραφείς; οὐ μᾶλλον ἢ ἵππος ἵππῳ ἢ κύων κυνὶ ἢ μέλισσα μελίσσῃ. ἀλλὰ τὰ πράγματα ἑκάστῳ φοβερά ἐστιν· ταῦτα δʼ ὅταν περιποιεῖν τις δύνηταί τινι ἢ ἀφελέσθαι, τότε καὶ αὐτὸς φοβερὸς γίνεται. πῶς οὖν ἀκρόπολις καταλύεται; οὐ σιδήρῳ οὐδὲ πυρί, ἀλλὰ δόγμασιν. ἂν γὰρ τὴν οὖσαν ἐν τῇ πόλει καθέλωμεν, μή τι καὶ τὴν τοῦ πυρετοῦ, μή τι καὶ τὴν τῶν καλῶν γυναικαρίων, μή τι ἁπλῶς τὴν ἐν ἡμῖν ἀκρόπολιν καὶ τοὺς ἐν ἡμῖν τυράννους ἀποβεβλήκαμεν, οὓς ἐφʼ ἑκάστοις καθʼ ἡμέραν ἔχομεν, ποτὲ μὲν τοὺς αὐτούς, ποτὲ δʼ ἄλλους; ἀλλʼ ἔνθεν ἄρξασθαι δεῖ καὶ ἔνθεν καθελεῖν τὴν ἀκρόπολιν, ἐκβάλλειν τοὺς τυράννους· τὸ σωμάτιον ἀφεῖναι, τὰ μέρη αὐτοῦ, τὰς δυνάμεις, τὴν κτῆσιν, τὴν φήμην, ἀρχάς, τιμάς, τέκνα, ἀδελφούς, φίλους, πάντα ταῦτα ἡγήσασθαι ἀλλότρια. κἂν ἔνθεν ἐκβληθῶσιν οἱ τύραννοι, τί ἔτι ἀποτειχίζω τὴν ἀκρόπολιν ἐμοῦ γε ἕνεκα; ἑστῶσα γὰρ τί μοι ποιεῖ; τί ἔτι ἐκβάλλω τοὺς δορυφόρους; ποῦ γὰρ αὐτῶν αἰσθάνομαι; ἐπʼ ἄλλους ἔχουσιν τὰς ῥάβδους καὶ τοὺς κοντοὺς καὶ τὰς μαχαίρας. ἐγὼ δʼ οὐπώποτʼ οὔτε θέλων ἐκωλύθην οὔτʼ ἠναγκάσθην μὴ θέλων καὶ πῶς τοῦτο δυνατόν; προσκατατέταχά μου τὴν ὁρμὴν τῷ θεῷ. θέλει μʼ ἐκεῖνος πυρέσσειν· κἀγὼ θέλω. θέλει ὁρμᾶν ἐπί τι· κἀγὼ θέλω. θέλει ὀρέγεσθαι· κἀγὼ θέλω. θέλει με τυχεῖν τινος· κἀγὼ βούλομαι. οὐ θέλει· οὐ βούλομαι. ἀποθανεῖν οὖν θέλω· στρεβλωθῆναι οὖν θέλω. τίς ἔτι με κωλῦσαι δύναται παρὰ τὸ ἐμοὶ φαινόμενον ἢ ἀναγκάσαι; οὐ μᾶλλον ἢ τὸν Δία. οὕτως ποιοῦσι καὶ τῶν ὁδοιπόρων οἱ ἀσφαλέστεροι. ἀκήκοεν ὅτι λῃστεύεται ἡ ὁδός· μόνος οὐ τολμᾷ καθεῖναι, ἀλλὰ περιέμεινεν συνοδίαν ἢ πρεσβευτοῦ ἢ ταμίου ἢ ἀνθυπάτου καὶ προσκατατάξας ἑαυτὸν παρέρχεται ἀσφαλῶς. οὕτως καὶ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ ποιεῖ ὁ φρόνιμος. πολλὰ λῃστήρια, τύραννοι, χειμῶνες, ἀπορίαι, ἀποβολαὶ τῶν φιλτάτων. ποῦ τις καταφύγῃ; πῶς ἀλῄστευτος παρέλθῃ; ποίαν συνοδίαν περιμείνας ἀσφαλῶς διέλθῃ; τίνι προσκατατάξας ἑαυτόν; τῷ δεῖνι, τῷ πλουσίῳ, τῷ ὑπατικῷ. καὶ τί μοι ὄφελος; αὐτὸς ἐκδύεται, οἰμώζει, πενθεῖ. τί δʼ, ἂν ὁ συνοδοιπόρος αὐτὸς ἐπʼ ἐμὲ στραφεὶς λῃστής μου γένηται; τί ποιήσω; φίλος ἔσομαι Καίσαρος· ἐκείνου με ὄντα ἑταῖρον οὐδεὶς ἀδικήσει. πρῶτον μέν, ἵνα γένωμαι, π ρ καὶ οὗτος θνητός ἂν δʼ αὐτὸς ἔκ τινος περιστάσεως ἐχθρός μου γένηται, ἀναχωρῆσαί πού ποτε κρεῖσσον;

— πῶς γὰρ ἄλλως ἢ ἐπισκεψαμένῳ τὰς ὁρμὰς τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τὴν διοίκησιν; τί μοι δέδωκεν ἐμὸν καὶ αὐτεξούσιον, τί αὑτῷ κατέλ ε τί οὖν θεομαχῶ; τί θέλω τὰ μὴ θελητά, τὰ μὴ δοθέντα μοι ἐξ ἅπαντος ἔχειν; ἀλλὰ πῶς; ὡς δέδοται καὶ ἐφʼ ὅσον δύναται. ἀλλʼ ὁ δοὺς ἀφαιρεῖται. τί οὖν ἀντιτείνω; οὐ λέγω, ὅτι ἠλίθιος ἔσομαι τὸν ἰσχυρότερον βιαζόμενος, ἀλλʼ ἔτι πρότερον ἄδικος. πόθεν γὰρ ἔχων αὐτὰ ἦλθον; ὁ πατήρ μου αὐτὰ ἔδωκεν. ἐκείνῳ δὲ τίς; τὸν ἥλιον δὲ τίς πεποίηκε, τοὺς καρποὺς δὲ τίς, τὰς δʼ ὥρας τίς, τὴν δὲ πρὸς ἀλλήλους συμπλοκὴν καὶ κοινωνίαν τίς; εἶτα σύμπαντα εἰληφὼς παρʼ ἄλλου καὶ αὐτὸν σεαυτόν, ἀγανακτεῖς καὶ μέμφῃ τὸν δόντα, ἄν σού τι ἀφέληται; τίς ὢν καὶ ἐπὶ τί ἐληλυθώς; οὐχὶ ἐκεῖνός σε εἰσήγαγεν; οὐχὶ τὸ φῶς ἐκεῖνός σοι ἔδειξεν; οὐ συνεργοὺς δέδωκεν; οὐ καὶ αἰσθήσεις; οὐ λόγον; ὡς τίνα δὲ εἰσήγαγεν; οὐχ ὡς θνητόν; οὐχ ὡς μετὰ ὀλίγου σαρκιδίου ζήσοντα ἐπὶ γῆς καὶ θεασόμενον τὴν διοίκησιν αὐτοῦ καὶ συμπομπεύσοντα αὐτῷ καὶ συνεορτάσοντα πρὸς ὀλίγον; οὐ θέλεις οὖν, ἕως δέδοταί σοι, θεασάμενος τὴν πομπὴν καὶ τὴν πανήγυριν εἶτα, ὅταν σʼ ἐξάγῃ, πορεύεσθαι προσκυνήσας καὶ εὐχαριστήσας ὑπὲρ ὧν ἤκουσας καὶ εἶδες; οὔ· ἀλλʼ ἔτι ἑορτάζειν ἤθελον. — ναί· ἀλλὰ τὰ τεκνία μετʼ ἐμαυτοῦ εἶναι θέλω καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα. — σὰ γάρ ἐστιν; οὐχὶ τοῦ δόντος; οὐχὶ καὶ τοῦ σὲ πεποιηκότος; εἶτα οὐκ ἐκστήσῃ τῶν ἀλλοτρίων; οὐ παραχωρήσεις τῷ κρείσσονι; — τί οὖν μʼ εἰσῆγεν ἐπὶ τούτοις; — καὶ εἰ μὴ ποιεῖ σοι, ἔξελθε· οὐκ ἔχει χρείαν θεατοῦ μεμψιμοίρου. τῶν συνεορταζόντων δεῖται, τῶν συγχορευόντων, ἵνʼ ἐπικροτῶσι μᾶλλον, ἐπιθειάζωσιν, ὑμνῶσι δὲ τὴν πανήγυριν. τοὺς ἀταλαιπώρους δὲ καὶ δειλοὺς οὐκ ἀηδῶς ὄψεται ἀπολελειμμένους τῆς πανηγύρεως· οὐδὲ γὰρ παρόντες ὡς ἐν ἑορτῇ διῆγον οὐδʼ ἐξεπλήρουν τὴν χώραν τὴν πρέπουσαν, ἀλλʼ ὠδυνῶντο, ἐμέμφοντο τὸν δαίμονα, τὴν τύχην, τοὺς συνόντας· ἀναίσθητοι καὶ ὧν ἔτυχον καὶ τῶν ἑαυτῶν δυνάμεων, ἃς εἰλήφασι πρὸς τὰ ἐναντία, μεγαλοψυχίας, γενναιότητος, ἀνδρείας, αὐτῆς τῆς νῦν ζητουμένης ἐλευθερίας. — ἐπὶ τί οὖν εἴληφα ταῦτα; — χρησόμενος. — μέχρι τίνος; — μέχρις ἂν ὁ χρήσας θέλῃ. — ἂν οὖν ἀναγκαῖά μοι ᾖ; — μὴ πρόσπασχε αὐτοῖς καὶ οὐκ ἔσται. σὺ αὐτὰ αὑτῷ μὴ εἴπῃς ἀναγκαῖα καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν. ταύτην τὴν μελέτην ἕωθεν εἰς ἑσπέραν μελετᾶν ἔδει. ἀπὸ τῶν μικροτάτων, ἀπὸ τῶν εὐεπηρεαστοτάτων ἀρξάμενος, ἀπὸ χύτρας, ἀπὸ ποτηρίου, εἶθʼ οὕτως ἐπὶ χιτωνάριον πρόσελθε, ἐπὶ κυνάριον, ἐπὶ ἱππάριον, ἐπὶ ἀγρίδιον· ἔνθεν ἐπὶ σαυτόν, τὸ σῶμα, τὰ μέρη τοῦ σώματος, τὰ τέκνα, τὴν γυναῖκα, τοὺς ἀδελφούς. πανταχοῦ περιβλέψας ἀπόρριψον ἀπὸ σεαυτοῦ· κάθηρον τὰ δόγματα, μή τι προσήρτηταί σοι τῶν οὐ σῶν, μή τι συμπέφυκεν, μή τι ὀδυνήσει σʼ ἀποσπώμενον. καὶ λέγε γυμναζόμενος καθʼ ἡμέραν, ὡς ἐκεῖ, μὴ ὅτι φιλοσοφεῖς (ἔστω φορτικὸν τὸ ὄνομα), ἀλλʼ ὅτι καρπιστὴν δίδως. τοῦτο γάρ ἐστιν ἡ ταῖς ἀληθείαις ἐλευθερία. ταύτην ἠλευθερώθη Διογένης παρʼ Ἀντισθένους καὶ οὐκέτι ἔφη καταδουλωθῆναι δύνασθαι ὑπʼ οὐδενός. διὰ τοῦτο πῶς ἑάλω, πῶς τοῖς πειραταῖς ἐχρῆτο· μή τι κύριον εἶπέν τινα αὐτῶν;

εἰ γὰρ παιδοτρίβην ἐώνητο, ἐν τοῖς παλαιστρικοῖς ὑπηρέτῃ ἂν αὐτῷ ἐχρῆτο ἢ κυρίῳ; εἰ δʼ ἰατρόν, ὡσαύτως, εἰ δʼ ἀρχιτέκτονα. καὶ οὕτως ἐφʼ ἑκάστης ὕλης τὸν ἔμπειρον τοῦ ἀπείρου κρατεῖν πᾶσα ἀνάγκη. ὅστις οὖν καθόλου τὴν περὶ βίον ἐπιστήμην κέκτηται, τί ἄλλο ἢ τοῦτον εἶναι δεῖ τὸν δεσπότην; τίς γάρ ἐστιν ἐν νηὶ κύριος; — ὁ κυβερνήτης. — διὰ τί; ὅτι ὁ ἀπειθῶν αὐτῷ ζημιοῦται. — ἀλλὰ δεῖραί με δύναται. — μή τι οὖν ἀζημίως; — οὕτως μὲν κἀγὼ ἔκρινον. — ἀλλʼ ὅτι οὐκ ἀζημίως, διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἔξεστιν· οὐδενὶ δʼ ἀζήμιόν ἐστι τὸ ποιεῖν τὰ ἄδικα. — καὶ τίς ἡ ζημία τῷ δήσαντι τὸν αὑτοῦ δοῦλον, ἣν δοκεῖς; — τὸ δῆσαι· τοῦτο ὃ καὶ σὺ ὁμολογήσεις, ἂν θέλῃς σῴζειν, ὅτι ἄνθρωπος οὐκ ἔστι θηρίον, ἀλλʼ ἥμερον ζῷον. ἐπεὶ πότʼ ἄμπελος πράσσει κακῶς; ὅταν παρὰ τὴν ἑαυτῆς φύσιν πράσσῃ. πότʼ ἀλεκτρυών; ὡσαύτως. οὐκοῦν καὶ ἄνθρωπος. τίς οὖν αὐτοῦ ἡ φύσις;

— οὔ, ἀλλʼ ὁ ἀποκτείνας αὐτόν. — πῶς λέγεις; — ὡς καὶ σὺ ἀλεκτρυόνα οὐ λέγεις κακῶς πρᾶξαι τὸν νικήσαντα καὶ κατακοπέντα, ἀλλὰ τὸν ἀπλῆγα ἡττηθέντα· οὐδὲ κύνα εὐδαιμονίζεις τὸν μήτε διώκοντα μήτε πονοῦντα, ἀλλʼ ὅταν ἱδρῶντα ἴδῃς, ὅταν ὀδυνώμενον, ὅταν ῥηγνύμενον ὑπὸ τοῦ δρόμου. τί παραδοξολογοῦμεν, εἰ λέγομεν παντὸς κακὸν εἶναι τὸ παρὰ τὴν ἐκείνου φύσιν; τοῦτο παράδοξόν ἐστιν; σὺ γὰρ αὐτὸ ἐπὶ πάντων τῶν ἄλλων οὐ λέγεις; διὰ τί ἐπὶ μόνου οὖν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἄλλως φέρῃ; ἀλλʼ ὅτι λέγομεν ἥμερον εἶναι τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τὴν φύσιν καὶ φιλάλληλον καὶ πιστήν, τοῦτο παράδοξον οὐκ ἔστιν;

ἄγε οὖν ἐπέλθωμεν τὰ ὡμολογημένα. ὁ ἀκώλυτος ἄνθρωπος ἐλεύθερος, ᾧ πρόχειρα τὰ πράγματα ὡς βούλεται. ὃν δʼ ἔστιν ἢ κωλῦσαι ἢ ἀναγκάσαι ἢ ἐμποδίσαι ἢ ἄκοντα εἴς τι ἐμβαλεῖν, δοῦλός ἐστιν. τίς δʼ ἀκώλυτος; ὁ μηδενὸς τῶν ἀλλοτρίων ἐφιέμενος. τίνα δʼ ἀλλότρια; ἃ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐφʼ ἡμῖν οὔτʼ ἔχειν οὔτε μὴ ἔχειν οὔτε ποιὰ ἔχειν ἢ πῶς ἔχοντα. οὐκοῦν τὸ σῶμα ἀλλότριον, τὰ μέρη αὐτοῦ ἀλλότρια, ἡ κτῆσις ἀλλοτρία. ἂν οὖν τινι τούτων ὡς ἰδίῳ προσπαθῇς, δώσεις δίκας ἃς ἄξιον τὸν τῶν ἀλλοτρίων ἐφιέμενον. αὕτη ἡ ὁδὸς ἐπʼ ἐλευθερίαν ἄγει, αὕτη μόνη ἀπαλλαγὴ δουλείας, μόνῃ ἀλλὰ τί λέγεις, φιλόσοφε;

— Ἐσκεπτόμην. — τίνα οὖν ἤρεσκεν ὑμῖν; — τὰ δίκαια καὶ καλὰ ἀγαθὰ εἶναι, τὰ ἄδικα καὶ αἰσχρὰ κακά. — μή τι τὸ ζῆν ἀγαθόν; — οὔ. — μή τι τὸ ἀποθανεῖν κακόν; — οὔ. — μή τι φυλακή; — οὔ. — λόγος δʼ ἀγεννὴς καὶ ἄπιστος καὶ φίλου προδοσία καὶ κολακεία τυράννου τί ὑμῖν ἐφαίνετο; — κακά. — τί οὖν; οὐχὶ σκέπτῃ, οὐχὶ δʼ ἔσκεψαι καὶ βεβούλευσαι. ποία γὰρ σκέψις, εἰ καθήκει μοὶ δυναμένῳ τὰ μέγιστα ἀγαθὰ ἐμαυτῷ περιποιῆσαι, τὰ μέγιστα κακὰ μὴ περιποιῆσαι; καλὴ σκέψις καὶ ἀναγκαία, πολλῆς βουλῆς δεομένη. τί ἡμῖν ἐμπαίζεις, ἄνθρωπε; οὐδέποτε τοιαύτη σκέψις γίνεται. οὐδʼ εἰ ταῖς ἀληθείαις κακὰ μὲν ἐφαντάζου τὰ αἰσχρά, τὰ δʼ ἄλλα οὐδέτερα, ἦλθες ἂν ἐπὶ ταύτην τὴν ἐπίστασιν, οὐδʼ ἐγγύς· ἀλλʼ αὐτόθεν διακρίνειν εἶχες, ὥσπερ ὄψει τῇ διανοίᾳ. πότε γὰρ σκέπτῃ, εἰ τὰ μέλανα λευκά ἐστιν, εἰ τὰ βαρέα κοῦφα; οὐχὶ δὲ τοῖς ἐναργῶς φαινομένοις ἐπακολουθεῖς; πῶς οὖν νῦν σκέπτεσθαι λέγεις, εἰ τὰ οὐδέτερα τῶν κακῶν φευκτότερα; ἀλλʼ οὐκ ἔχεις τὰ δόγματα ταῦτα, ἀλλὰ φαίνεταί σοι οὔτε ταῦτα οὐδέτερα, ἀλλὰ τὰ μέγιστα κακά, οὔτʼ ἐκεῖνα κακά, ἀλλʼ οὐδὲν πρὸς ἡμᾶς. οὕτως γὰρ ἐξ ἀρχῆς εἴθισας σεαυτόν· ποῦ εἰμι;

ἀλλʼ ὅτι σου τὸ ἔλαιον ἐξεχέθη, ὁ οἶνος ἐξεπόθη, ἵνα τις ἐπιστὰς διατεινομένῳ σοι τοῦτʼ αὐτὸ μόνον εἴπῃ φιλόσοφε, ἄλλα λέγεις ἐν τῇ σχολῇ· τί ἡμᾶς ἐξαπατᾷς; τί σκώληξ ὢν λέγεις, ὅτι ἄνθρωπος εἶ; ἤθελον ἐπιστῆναί τινι αὐτῶν συνουσιάζοντι, ἵνα ἴδω, πῶς τείνεται καὶ ποίας φωνὰς ἀφίησιν, εἰ μέμνηται τοῦ ὀνόματος αὐτοῦ, τῶν λόγων οὓς ἀκούει ἢ λέγει ἢ ἀναγιγνώσκει. καὶ τί ταῦτα πρὸς ἐλευθερίαν;— οὐκ ἄλλα μὲν οὖν ἢ ταῦτʼ, ἄν τε θέλητε ὑμεῖς οἱ πλούσιοι ἄν τε μή. — καὶ τί ς οὐ δύναμαι τοῦτο ποιῆσαι· οὐκ ἐξεστί μοι;

    "notes": "This passage marks the beginning of Discourses 4.2, dealing with the danger of social contagion. Epictetus warns the student (prokoptōn) that moral character is not static; it is influenced by the company one keeps. Just as physical illness can be transmitted by contact, so too can mental habits and values. The Stoic insight here is that until one has a mind of steel (like a Sage), interacting with non-philosophers (idiōtēs) who value external things carries a grave risk of sliding back into old vices. One must be vigilant to protect one's own ruling faculty (hegemonikon) from being dragged down by the habits of the crowd.",

    "english": "Regarding social intercourse: You must pay attention to this point above all others. Do not let yourself be so absorbed by your former acquaintances or friends that you descend to their level; otherwise, you will ruin yourself. If the thought occurs to you, 'I will seem unsociable to him, and he will not treat me as he did before,' then make your choice! Which do you prefer: to be loved by them as before by remaining your old self, or to be a better person and miss out on that specific regard? If the latter is better, turn toward it immediately and let no other reasoning distract you. No one can make progress while straddling the fence. If you have decided this path is superior, if you wish to devote yourself to this alone, then abandon all the rest. Otherwise, this vacillation will cause you to lose on both fronts: you will neither make the progress you are capable of, nor will you obtain what you used to get from your old life. Formerly, you were pleasant to your companions because you genuinely desired the same trivial things they did. You cannot excel in both roles. Necessarily, to the extent that you share in the one, you fall behind in the other. You cannot refuse to drink with your drinking buddies and still appear as pleasant to them; so choose: do you want to be a drunkard and pleasant to them, or a sober man and unpleasant? You cannot stop singing with those who sing and be loved by them as before. Make your choice here as well. If it is better to be modest and self-controlled than to be called a 'fun guy,' then choose that. But if this does not please you, then tilt your whole weight to the opposite side: become one of the degenerates, one of the adulterers, do everything that follows, and jump up to shout for the dancer! Differing characters do not mix. You cannot act the part of Thersites and Agamemnon at the same time. If you want to be Thersites, you must be hunchbacked and bald; if Agamemnon, you must be tall, handsome, and a lover of your subjects.",
    "notes": "This section of the Discourses (4.2) deals with the high cost of moral transformation and the danger of social contagion. Epictetus emphasizes the concept of 'Consistency' (homologia). One cannot pursue the path of the philosopher (virtue, self-control, sobriety) while maintaining the approval of those whose lives are built on vice (excess, triviality). Trying to please everyone leads to 'wavering' (epamphoterizein), which guarantees failure in both spiritual progress and social standing. The student must accept that becoming 'better' often means becoming 'disagreeable' to those who remain in the old life. The concluding metaphor contrasts Thersites (a symbol of the ignoble, chaotic buffoon) with Agamemnon (the noble leader), illustrating that one's character must be coherent; you cannot wear the mask of a king and a fool simultaneously.",

    "english": "Consider carefully what things are to be exchanged for what. Keep this principle ready at hand: whenever you relinquish something external, ask yourself what you are acquiring in its place. If what you gain is of greater value, never say that you have suffered a loss. You do not lose when you exchange a donkey for a horse, a sheep for an ox, a little money for a noble action, idle chatter for proper silence, or obscenity for modesty. By remembering this, you will preserve your character everywhere just as it ought to be. But if you fail to do this, know that your time is wasted, and all the attention you have paid to yourself up to now will be spilled out and overturned. Very little is required to ruin and upset everything: just a slight deviation from reason. To capsize his ship, the pilot does not need as much preparation as he does to save it; if he turns it only slightly against the wind, it is lost; even if he does not do it intentionally but merely neglects his duty and dozes off, it is lost. The situation is similar here: if you nod off for a moment, everything you have gathered up to this point is gone. Therefore, pay attention to your impressions! Watch over them sleeplessly. For what you are guarding is no small thing: it is respect, fidelity, stability, freedom from passion, freedom from grief, freedom from fear, tranquility—in short, freedom. For what price are you willing to sell these? Look at what they are worth. You say, 'But I shall not get anything like that in return.' I answer: Look again at what you receive in exchange, even if you do obtain that external thing. I have decency, he has a tribuneship; he has a praetorship, I have self-respect. I do not shout where it is unbecoming; I do not stand up where I should not. For I am free and a friend of God, that I may obey Him willingly. I must lay claim to nothing else—not body, nor property, nor office, nor reputation—absolutely nothing. For God does not wish me to lay claim to them; had He wished it, He would have made them good for me. As it is, He has not done so; therefore, I cannot transgress His commands. Guard your own good in everything; regarding other matters, accept what is given only so far as to make reasonable use of it, and be content with this alone. Otherwise, you will be unfortunate, unlucky, hindered, and obstructed. These are the laws sent from God, these are His ordinances; you must become an interpreter of these and be subject to these, not to the laws of Masurius and Cassius.",
    "notes": "This section defines the 'Stoic Economy' of decision-making. Epictetus teaches that every action involves a trade-off: when we pursue externals (money, office, pleasure), we often pay with our internal character (modesty, fidelity, freedom). The core practice here is 'Prosochē' (constant vigilance). Epictetus uses the metaphor of a ship's pilot to demonstrate that while building character requires sustained effort, destroying it takes only a moment of inattention or a minor deviation from reason. The ultimate goal is to value 'prohairesis' (moral character) above all else. By aligning one's will with the 'Laws of God' (Nature)—which dictate that only virtue is good and only vice is bad—the Stoic becomes a 'friend of God,' immune to the anxieties that plague those who value external things over their own integrity. The reference to Masurius and Cassius (famous Roman jurists) serves to contrast the temporary, human laws of the state with the eternal, unwritten laws of Nature.",

    "english": "To those eager to live a quiet life. Remember this: it is not only the desire for public office and wealth that makes men abject and subservient to others; the desire for tranquility, leisure, travel, and scholarship does exactly the same. For, quite simply, it is the nature of the external object that enslaves, regardless of what it is. What difference is there between craving to be a senator and craving not to be a senator? What difference between desiring office and desiring to avoid it? What difference is there between saying, 'I am miserable because I have nothing to do and am tied to my books like a corpse,' and saying, 'I am miserable because I have no leisure to read'? For just as salutations and political power are external things beyond your control, so is a book. Why do you wish to read? Tell me. If you do it merely for amusement or to pass the time, you are dead. But if you refer it to the proper end, what is that end if not a prosperous and flowing life? And yet, if your reading does not secure you against frustration, what good is it? You say, 'But I do feel a flow of well-being while reading, and that is why I am angry when deprived of it.' And what is this 'flow' that any chance passerby can interrupt? I do not speak of the Emperor or his friend, but a crow, a flute-player, a fever, or ten thousand other things? A true flow of life consists in being continuous and unhindered. Now, suppose I am called to do something. I must go to attend to the measures I must observe—to act modestly, steadily, without desire or aversion toward externals. I must observe men: what they say, how they move; and I do this not with malice, nor to find fault or mock, but to turn my gaze inward upon myself, to see if I, too, commit the same errors. 'How then shall I cease to err?' Once I was like them, but now I am not, thanks be to God. Come now, when you have done these things and attended to this work, have you done a worse act than if you had read a thousand lines or written as many? When you eat, are you vexed that you are not reading? Are you not satisfied to eat according to your reading? And when you bathe or exercise? Why then do you not preserve this consistency in all things, even when you approach Caesar or any other person? If you maintain yourself free from passion, fear, and agitation; if you observe what happens rather than being observed; if you do not envy those who are preferred before you; if materials do not dazzle you—what do you still lack? Books? How, or to what end? Is not reading a preparation for life? And is not life itself composed of things other than books? It is as if an athlete, upon entering the stadium, should weep because he is not training outside in the gym. It was for this that you were training! The weights, the dust, the young practice partners—they were for this moment. And now you seek those things when it is the time for action? It is as if, in the sphere of assent, when we are presented with impressions—some distinct, some indistinct—we should not wish to distinguish between them, but rather read a treatise 'On Comprehension.' What is the reason for this? It is because we never read for this purpose, nor wrote for this purpose—that in our actions we might deal with impressions according to nature. We content ourselves with merely learning what is said, able to explain it to another, to analyze a syllogism, or trace a hypothetical argument. Therefore, where your eagerness is, there is your hindrance. Do you desire things not in your power? Then you must be hindered, obstructed, and fail. But if we read treatises 'On Impulse' not merely to see what is said about impulse, but to exercise our impulses correctly, we would not be vexed when hindered in our reading; rather, we would be content to perform the actions required by the moment. You say, 'I did not read as many lines today as I wanted,' but instead you should say, 'Today I employed my impulse as the philosophers prescribe; I did not employ desire; I practiced avoidance only on things within my control; I was not awed by such a one, nor was I shamed by him; I exercised my patience, my abstinence, my cooperation.' But as it is, we do not realize that we are becoming like the vulgar, only in a different way. Another man fears he shall not hold office; you fear you *will* hold office. By no means, man! But just as you laugh at the one who fears he will not hold office, so laugh at yourself. For there is no difference between being thirsty while in a fever or fearing water like a madman. How then can you say with Socrates, 'If it pleases God, so let it be'? Do you think Socrates, if he had longed to idle in the Lyceum or the Academy and discourse daily with young men, could have served in his military campaigns so readily? Would he not have lamented, 'Woe is me, I am miserable here in Potidaea while I might be sunning myself in the Lyceum'? Was that your work, to sun yourself? Was it not rather to be prosperous, hindered by nothing, and impeded by nothing? And how would he have still been Socrates if he had lamented these things? How could he have written hymns in prison? Remember this simply: whatever external thing you value outside of your own reasoned choice, you have destroyed your choice. And not only is office external, but so is the avoidance of office; not only is business external, but so is leisure. 'But now I must live in this tumult!' Do not be hard to please or fastidious about events. 'The vinegar is bad, it is sharp; the honey is bad, it upsets my constitution; I do not want vegetables.' So you say, 'I do not want retirement, it is a desert; I do not want a crowd, it is a tumult.' But if circumstances necessitate that you live alone or with few, call it quiet and use the thing as you ought: talk to yourself, exercise your impressions, work on your preconceptions. If you fall into a crowd, call it the games, a festival, a holiday; try to keep the feast with your fellow men. For what is a pleasanter sight to a lover of mankind than a crowd of men? We look with pleasure on herds of horses or oxen; we are delighted when we see many ships. Does one hurt when seeing many men? 'But they deafen me with their shouting!' Then your hearing is hindered. What is that to you? Is your faculty of using impressions hindered? Who prevents you from desiring what is not natural or avoiding what is inevitable? No one. Remember only the general principles: What is mine? What is not mine? What is given to me? What does God want me to do now? A short time ago He wanted you to be at leisure, to talk to yourself, to read, to hear, to prepare. You had sufficient time for that. Now He says to you, 'Come now to the contest, show us what you have learned, how you have trained.' How long will you exercise alone? It is now time to know whether you are one of the athletes who deserves victory, or one of those who travel the world only to be defeated. Why are you vexed? No contest is held without confusion. There must be many training partners, many shouting, many masters, many spectators. 'But I wanted to live in quiet.' Then lament and groan as you deserve. For what greater penalty is there for the uninstructed and disobedient than to grieve, to mourn, to envy—in short, to be unfortunate and unhappy? Do you not want to free yourself from these things? 'And how shall I free myself?' Have you not heard often that you must entirely eradicate desire and turn your aversion only to things within the power of the will? That you must give up everything—body, property, fame, books, tumult, power, freedom from power? For to whatever object you turn, you become a slave, you are subject, you are hindered, you are compelled, you are entirely in the power of others. Instead, keep the verse of Cleanthes at hand: 'Lead me, O Zeus, and thou O Destiny.' Do you wish me to go to Rome? To Rome. To Gyara? To Gyara. To Athens? To Athens. To prison? To prison. If you once say, 'When shall I go to Athens?' you are undone. Leave all these things. Athens is beautiful? Yes, but happiness is far more beautiful: freedom from passion, tranquility, having your own affairs under no man's control. There is tumult in Rome and salutations? But happiness is there also, for the man who acts according to the will of nature. If you do not see this, understand that you are destined to be a slave always, serving him who has the power to banish you or impede you, and you must worship him as your Evil Genius. There is one way to a smooth flow of life (let this be ready at dawn, by day, and by night): complete detachment from things not in your own power, considering nothing as your own, surrendering everything to the divinity and to fortune, making them the guardians of those things which Zeus has already put in their care; and to be yourself concerned with one thing only—that which is your own, that which is unhindered; and to read with this reference, to write with this reference, and to listen with this reference. Therefore, I cannot call a man industrious merely because I hear he reads or writes; even if you add that he does so all night long, I cannot say it until I know the reference of his action. You do not call a man industrious who stays awake for the sake of a mistress, nor do I. If he does it for glory, I call him ambitious; if for money, fond of money, not fond of work. But if he refers his labor to his own ruling faculty, that he may keep it in accordance with nature, only then do I call him industrious. Never praise or blame men on account of common actions, but on account of their judgments. These are the peculiar property of each man, which make his actions base or noble. Remembering these things, rejoice in what is present and be content with the things of the moment. If you see any of those things which you have learned and studied presenting themselves in action, be glad of them. If you have laid aside malice and abuse, if you have lessened your rashness, your foul language, your inconsiderateness, your negligence; if you are not moved by what moved you before, or at least not in the same degree—you can celebrate a festival day after day: today because you behaved well in this action, tomorrow because of another. How much greater is this cause for sacrifice than a consulship or a governorship! These things come to you from yourself and from the gods. Remember who the Giver is, and to whom He gives, and for what purpose. Nourished by such thoughts, does it matter where you are to be happy, or where you are to please God? Are not all places equally distant from Him? Do not all places equally enjoy the view of what comes to pass?",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus attacks a subtle trap for the philosophy student: the attachment to 'peace and quiet.' He argues that craving a quiet library is no different from craving political power; both desires attach our happiness to external conditions (indifferents) that are outside our control (prohairesis). When we become angry at interruptions, we prove that we value our books more than our character. The core lesson is the distinction between 'preparation' (reading/training) and the 'contest' (life). Life serves us crowds, noise, and difficult people as the 'stadium' where we must prove our training. To resent the crowd is to be an athlete who weeps because he has to stop lifting weights and actually compete. True 'hard work' (philoponia) isn't reading all night; it is the constant, rigorous application of Stoic principles (eradicating desire for externals, using impressions correctly) to whatever situation Fate places us in, whether that be the quiet of Athens or the noise of Rome.",

    "english": "Regarding the quarrelsome and the brutal: The noble and good man neither fights with anyone himself, nor does he allow others to do so to the extent of his power. We have the life of Socrates set before us as an example of this, just as for other things; he not only avoided fighting everywhere himself, but did not permit others to fight either. Look at Xenophon's Symposium to see how many quarrels he resolved; how he tolerated Thrasymachus, how he endured Polus and Callicles; how he bore with his own wife, and how he tolerated his son who tried to refute him with sophistry. For he remembered quite securely that no one acts as master over another's ruling faculty. He desired, therefore, nothing but what was his own. And what is that? Not that 'this person shall act naturally'—for that is not in my power—but rather that 'while this person acts however they act, I shall maintain my own ruling faculty in accordance with nature.' \n\nBut you? If you wish your son not to do wrong, or your wife not to do wrong, you are wishing for things that are not your own to be your own. To be instructed is exactly this: to learn what is your own and what belongs to others. Where, then, is there any room left for fighting for the man who holds this view? He is not surprised by anything that happens, is he? Does anything seem new to him? Does he not expect worse and more difficult behavior from the wicked than what actually occurs? Does he not count it as pure gain whatever falls short of the absolute worst? \n\n'But so-and-so reviled you.' Many thanks to him that he did not strike me. 'But he also struck you.' Many thanks that he did not wound me. 'But he also wounded you.' Many thanks that he did not kill me. For when, or from whom, did he learn that man is a tame animal, a social animal, and that injustice is a great harm to the one doing the injustice? Since he has not learned this, nor is he convinced of it, why should he not follow what appears advantageous to him? 'My neighbor threw stones.' Did you commit a fault? 'No, but things in the house were broken.' Are you a piece of pottery? No, you are a moral will (prohairesis). What, then, has been given to you to meet this attack? If you act like a wolf, you bite back and throw more stones. But if you seek to act like a human being, look into your storehouse; see what faculties you brought with you into the world. Did you bring the faculty of brutality? Of grudging resentment? \n\nWhen is a horse miserable? When it is deprived of its natural faculties; not when it cannot crow like a rooster, but when it cannot run. And a dog? Not when it cannot fly, but when it cannot track. Is it not the same for a human being? A man is not wretched when he cannot strangle lions or embrace statues (for he brought no faculties for this from nature), but when he has lost his kindness and his faithfulness. This is the man for whom we should gather and mourn, thinking of the evils into which he has fallen! We should not mourn simply because he was born or died, but because while living he has lost what was his own—not his father’s estate, his land, his house, his inn, or his slaves (for none of these truly belong to a man, but are all alien, servile, subject, given now to some, now to others by their masters)—but because he lost his human qualities, the stamp of his character impressed upon his mind. \n\nWhatever stamp we look for on coins, if we find it, we approve; if not, we throw it away. 'Whose stamp does this four-as piece have? Trajan's?' Bring it here. 'Nero's?' Throw it out; it is invalid, it is rotten. So too with impressions: Is it gentle, social, tolerant, affectionate? Approve it. But look closely: does it have the stamp of Nero? Is it angry, vindictive, complaining? 'If it suits his fancy, he smashes the heads of those he meets.' Then throw it out! Why do you call him a man? Is everything judged merely by its outward form? If so, call a wax apple a real apple. No, it must have the smell and taste as well; the external shape is not enough. So, for a human, having a nose and eyes is not enough; he must have human judgments (dogmata). Here is a man who will not listen to reason, who does not understand when he is refuted; he is an ass. Here is one whose sense of shame is dead; he is useless, anything rather than a man. Here is one who looks for someone to kick or bite; he is not even a sheep or an ass, but some wild beast. \n\n'What then? Do you want me to be despised?' By whom? By those who know? And how will those who know despise the gentle and the modest? By those who do not know? What do you care? No artisan cares about the opinion of those unskilled in his art. 'But they will attack me all the more.' What do you mean by 'me'? Can anyone harm your moral will, or prevent you from using the impressions that come to you in accordance with nature? No. Why then are you still disturbed? Why do you want to show yourself as fearsome? Why do you not come forward in public and proclaim that you are at peace with all men, regardless of what they do, and that you laugh specifically at those who think they are harming you? \n\n'These slaves do not know who I am, nor where my good and evil lie; they have no access to what is truly mine.' This is how the inhabitants of a strong city laugh at their besiegers: 'What are these people doing now entirely in vain? Our wall is secure, we have food for a very long time, and all other supplies.' These are the things that make a city strong and impregnable; but for a human soul, it is nothing other than his judgments. For what kind of wall is so strong, or what body so adamantine, or what possession so theft-proof, or what reputation so unassailable? All things everywhere are mortal and easily captured; whoever sets his heart on them must necessarily be disturbed, discouraged, fearful, and mourning. \n\nSince this is so, do we not want to fortify the only safety given to us? Do we not want to withdraw from the mortal and the slavish, and work instead on the immortal and the naturally free? Do we not remember that no one harms another or benefits another, but it is the judgment concerning each of these things that harms, that overturns, that is the fight, the sedition, the war? What drove Eteocles and Polynices was nothing else but this: their judgment about tyranny and their judgment about exile—that the one was the greatest of goods and the other the greatest of evils. This is the nature of every living being: to pursue the good and flee the evil. Therefore, if a man takes away what one considers good and forces upon him what he considers evil, he will regard that man as an enemy and a plotter, even if he is a brother, a son, or a father. For nothing is more akin to us than the good. If these external things are good and evil, then no father is a friend to his sons, nor brother to brother; everywhere is full of enemies, plotters, and slanderers. But if the moral will (prohairesis) is the only good, and the wrong moral will the only evil, where is there left any room for war? Where is the abuse? About what? About things that are nothing to us? Against whom? Against the ignorant, the unfortunate, those who have been deceived about the greatest matters? \n\nSocrates remembered this and managed his house appropriately... But we? We are capable of writing these things and reading them, and praising them when they are read, but we are not even close to being convinced by them.",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus addresses the root of interpersonal conflict. The central Stoic doctrine here is that conflict arises only when we value 'externals' (status, bodies, possessions) over our own 'prohairesis' (moral choice/will). \n\n1. **The Fortress of the Mind:** Epictetus uses the metaphor of a besieged city. If your safety depends on walls (externals), you are vulnerable. If your safety depends on your judgments (*dogmata*), you are invincible. Conflict ceases when you realize no one can touch your ruling faculty (*hegemonikon*).\n\n2. **Dehumanization through Anger:** A powerful ethical argument is made: when you retaliate or act with aggression, you are not 'winning'; you are devolving. You lose the specific quality of a human being (reason and sociability) and become a beast (wolf, wasp, lion). The 'loss' in a conflict is suffered by the aggressor, who loses their character, not the victim who suffers physical harm.\n\n3. **The Coin Analogy:** This is a practical tool for mindfulness. We must test our impressions (*phantasiai*) like coins. If an impulse bears the 'stamp' of anger or unsociability (Nero), it is counterfeit currency in the economy of a good life and must be rejected.\n\n4. **Socratic Tolerance:** Socrates is presented as the ideal because he understood the dichotomy of control perfectly. He did not try to control the minds of others (even his difficult family or enemies), but maintained his own mind in harmony with nature. He viewed the ignorant not as enemies to be fought, but as blind people to be pitied.",

    "english": "To those who are distressed at being pitied. 'I am distressed,' someone says, 'because I am being pitied.' Tell me, is this business of being pitied your action, or the action of those who pity you? Is it in your power to stop it? 'It is, if I show them that I do not deserve pity.' But do you deserve pity right now, or do you not? 'I think I do not.' Yet these people do not pity you for the reasons you think—not for moral errors—but for poverty, lack of office, sickness, and death. Are you prepared, then to convince the mob that none of these things is an evil? No. The other path is to play the cheat: rent some slaves, possess a few silver vessels, show them off, dress in flashy clothes, and try to look like one of the 'important' people. This is the only way to escape their pity. The first way—convincing all mankind what is truly good and evil—is impossible; even Zeus could not do it. But has this not been given to you: to convince yourself? And you have not yet convinced yourself! And now you wish to convince others? Who has lived with you as long as you have with yourself? Who is more persuasive to you than you? Yet you are still unsettled. You have heard that the one path to freedom is to abandon things outside your will, yet you are bitten by pity. This proves you still think externals matter! Antisthenes said: 'It is a royal attribute, O Cyrus, to do good and be ill-spoken of.' My head is healthy, yet all think I have a headache; what do I care? I am poor, but I hold a correct judgment about poverty; what do I care if they pity me for it? They seek office; I seek right judgments. It is illogical for someone who puts no effort into a thing to expect the same reward as one who does. They wake up thinking of whom to flatter; you wake up thinking of how to keep your will in harmony with nature. If you were truly convinced that you possess the real Good and that they are the ones who are deceived, you would not even pay attention to what they say about you.",
    "notes": "In this lecture, Epictetus diagnoses a subtle contradiction in the student's mind. The student claims to be a philosopher but feels 'pain' when others pity him for his poverty or lack of status. Epictetus argues that this emotional reaction reveals a failure in the student's own training (askesis). If the student truly believed that poverty is indifferent (adiaphora) and that virtue is the only good, he would view the pity of the mob as a harmless error on their part, much like someone mistakenly thinking a healthy man has a headache. The anger at being pitied proves that the student still secretly values the opinion of the crowd and the material signs of success. The lesson emphasizes the 'Law of Trade-offs': one cannot pursue the internal peace of a philosopher while demanding the external reputation of a politician. You must choose one path and accept its consequences.",

    "english": "What makes the tyrant terrifying? Is it the guards, their tall stature, and their sharp swords? Is it the chamberlain who blocks the door? Why, then, if you bring a small child before them, is he not afraid? Is it not because the child does not comprehend these things? Now, consider a man who wishes to die—perhaps seeking relief from some agony—and actively seeks a quick end at another's hand. Does he fear the guards? No, for he desires the very thing they are equipped to do. \n\nSo, if a man were to hold the same attitude toward his possessions, his body, and his children as that man holds toward death—if, through reason rather than madness or mere habit (like the Galileans), he understood that God made the world self-sufficient but its parts to serve the whole—who could possibly master him? \n\nThe rational animal has the capacity to understand its place in the universe. He sees that some things are unhindered and within his power (prohairesis), while others are hindered and dependent on others. If he locates his Good solely in the unhindered—his choices—he will be free, happy, and pious, blaming no one. But if he locates his Good in externals, he must necessarily be thwarted, enslaved, and impious, for he will resent God for his losses. \n\nWhy are the guards' swords 'long and sharp'? To others, perhaps. To me, they are nothing. I have been set free by God; I know His commandments. No one can enslave me anymore. I have the right liberator and the right judges. Am I the master of my body? No. Of my little property? No. Of exile or chains? No. What, then, is left for me to fear? \n\n'But he will shut you out of the palace!' Let him shut me out if he finds me wishing to enter. 'Why do you go to the door then?' Because as long as the game continues, I think it fitting to play. 'But surely you will be shut out.' If I am not welcomed, I do not wish to enter; I always prefer what actually happens to what I wanted to happen. I consider what God wills to be better than what I will. I attach myself to Him as a servant and follower; my impulses, my desires, my will are one with His. \n\nListen to me: when you see people fighting over political posts and honors, imagine someone scattering figs and nuts. Children scramble and fight for them; grown men do not. Governorships are being distributed? Let the children scramble. Money? Let the children scramble. To me, these are mere figs and nuts. If one falls into my lap by chance, I may eat it, for one may value a fig that much—but I will not stoop and fight for it. \n\n'Show me the swords,' you say. Look how sharp they are! And what do they do? They kill the body. Nothing else? Nothing else. Very well. Once I have learned that everything born must perish so the universe may continue, it matters not to me whether a fever kills me or a soldier. In fact, the soldier is quicker. \n\nTherefore, do not envy the tyrant's favorites. They pay a price for their figs and nuts. You cannot have both the external prize and a clean, free Ruling Faculty. As long as you obsess over the external, your mind will remain dirty and neglected, while you admire the trinkets of slaves.",

Epictetus argues that fear is not caused by objects (tyrants, swords) but by our judgments regarding them. 1) The nature of invincibility: If you do not value what the tyrant controls (body, property, life), he has no handle by which to grasp you. You are only vulnerable if you desire what is not 'up to you.' 2) The 'Galileans' (Christians) reference: Epictetus notes their fearlessness of death but attributes it to habit/fanaticism, contrasting it with the Stoic fearlessness derived from reason and proof. 3) The 'Figs and Nuts' metaphor: This is essential Epictetian imagery. External goods (office, wealth) are toys. A philosopher may accept them if given ('falling in the lap'), but to fight for them is childish and undignified. 4) Alignment with the Divine: The ultimate freedom is 'Amor Fati'—loving fate. By aligning one's will with God's will (what actually happens), one can never be 'shut out' or disappointed. 5) The cost of freedom: You cannot have the peace of the philosopher and the perks of the courtier. You must choose between cultivating your 'Hegemonikon' (ruling faculty) or chasing external 'figs.'",

    "english": "To those who hastily rush to assume the guise of philosophers: Never praise or blame anyone on account of common externals, nor ascribe to them skill or lack of skill; by doing so, you will free yourself from both rashness and malice. 'This man bathes quickly.' Does he do it badly? No, only quickly. 'Is everything done well, then?' By no means; actions done from right principles are done well, and those from bad principles, badly. But until you understand the principle from which a man acts, do not praise the work nor blame it. A principle, however, is not easily judged from the outside. 'This man is a carpenter.' Why? 'He uses an adze.' 'This man is a musician.' Why? 'He sings.' 'This man is a philosopher.' Why? 'Because he wears a rough cloak and has long hair.' Yet, look at what philosophers actually do. If the profession of a philosopher is merely to wear a cloak and hair, then they are right; but if it is rather to keep the ruling faculty free from error, why do we not strip the title from those who fail to fulfill the profession? We do this in other trades. If you see someone hacking badly with an axe, you do not say, 'What is the use of carpentry?' You say, 'This man is no carpenter.' But in philosophy alone, when people see someone acting contrary to the profession, they do not take away the title; instead, assuming he is a philosopher and seeing his shameful behavior, they conclude that philosophy itself is useless. The cause is that we respect the definition of the carpenter, but regarding the philosopher, our definition is confused and judged only by externals. What is the subject matter of the philosopher? The cloak? No, it is Reason. What is the end? To wear a cloak? No, to possess right Reason. Therefore, Euphrates spoke well when he said, 'I tried to conceal that I was a philosopher for a long time, and this was beneficial to me.' For I knew that whatever I did well, I did not do for the spectators, but for myself and for God. It was I alone who struggled, and I alone who faced the danger. If I did anything shameful, the cause of philosophy was not endangered; nor did I harm the masses by sinning as a philosopher. Why is it bad to be recognized as a philosopher by your actions, but not by your insignia? Socrates was so hidden from the masses that they came to him asking to be introduced to philosophers. Did he get angry and say, 'Do I not look like a philosopher to you?' No. Man, undergo winter training first! Look at your impulse; see if it is not just a weak stomach or the craving of a pregnant woman. Practice concealing who you are for a while; philosophize for yourself. Fruit is produced in this way: the seed must first be buried for a time, hidden, and grown by degrees, so that it may come to perfection. But if you produce the ear before the stalk has jointed, it is imperfect—a mere plant for the Garden of Adonis. You are such a plant; you have blossomed too soon, and the winter will scorch you up. Let us ripen naturally. Why do you strip us? Why do you force us? We cannot yet bear the air. Let the root grow, then the first joint, then the second; then the fruit will force its way out naturally, even if I do not will it. For who, when he is pregnant with such great principles, does not perceive his own capacity and rush toward the appropriate actions? A bull is not ignorant of his own nature and capacity when a wild beast appears; he does not wait for someone to encourage him. If I have the equipment of a good man, I will show it. But now I do not yet have it; believe me. Why then do you wish to wither me away before my time, just as you have been withered?",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus attacks the vanity of 'costume philosophy'—the tendency of students to adopt the beard, cloak, and staff of the philosopher before they have actually internalized the doctrines. The core lesson is the distinction between 'Acting' (displaying the symbols of virtue) and 'Being' (possessing the ruling principle of virtue). Epictetus uses the metaphor of agriculture: a seed must be buried and hidden to develop strong roots before it can bear fruit. If a plant shoots up too quickly (the 'Garden of Adonis,' referring to quick-sprouting herbs used in rituals that died immediately), it will be destroyed by the first frost (adversity). Practical application: 1) Do not judge others by their appearance or job titles, but by the principles (dogmata) that drive their actions. 2) Do not announce yourself as a Stoic to the world. Conceal your progress. Let your actions speak only when your principles are so engrained that they cannot be shaken. 3) Doing good 'for oneself and for God' is the antidote to vanity; if you need an audience to be virtuous, you are not yet a philosopher.",

    "english": "To the person who has lapsed into shamelessness. When you see another man in power, set this against it: that you possess the advantage of not needing power. When you see another man rich, look and see what you have instead. For if you have nothing in its place, you are indeed miserable; but if you have the independence of not needing wealth, know that you possess something greater and of far more value. Another possesses a beautiful woman; you possess the power of not desiring a beautiful woman. Do these things seem small to you? And how much would these very men—the rich, the powerful, and those who live with beautiful women—pay to be able to despise wealth and power and those very women whom they love and possess? Do you not realize what the thirst of a fever is like? It bears no resemblance to the thirst of a healthy man. The healthy man drinks and his thirst ceases. But the other is pleased for a moment, then becomes nauseous, turns the drink into bile, vomits, gets cramps, and thirsts even more violently. Such is the condition of the man who is rich with desire, who holds office with desire, who sleeps with a beautiful woman with desire: jealousy comes with it, fear of loss, shameful words, shameful thoughts, and unseemly deeds. 'And what,' he asks, 'am I losing?' Man, you used to be modest, and now you are not. Have you lost nothing? Instead of Chrysippus and Zeno, you now read Aristeides and Evenus. Have you lost nothing? Instead of Socrates and Diogenes, you admire the man who can corrupt and seduce the most women. You want to be handsome and you make yourself up, though you are not; you want to display flashy clothes to attract women's attention; and if you find some cheap perfume, you think yourself happy. Formerly, you did not think of any of these things; but where now is your decent speech, your character as a man of worth, your noble thinking? So, you used to sleep like a man, walk like a man, wear a man's clothes, and speak in a way that befits a good man; and yet you say to me, 'I have lost nothing'? Do men lose nothing but coins? Is modesty not lost? Is decency not lost? Or does the man who loses these things suffer no penalty? Perhaps you think that none of these things matters anymore; yet there was a time when you accounted this the only loss and damage, when you were anxious lest anyone should shake you from these principles and actions. Look, you have been shaken from them, not by another, but by yourself. Fight against yourself; reclaim yourself for decency, for modesty, for freedom. If someone had told you these things about me—that someone was forcing me to commit adultery, to wear such clothes, to scent myself with perfume—would you not have gone and killed the man who so abused me? But now, will you not help yourself? And how much easier is this help? There is no need to kill anyone, nor to fetter him, nor to insult him, nor to go out into the market, but only to speak to yourself, the person who will be most easily persuaded, and with whom no one has more influence than you. First, condemn what you are doing; then, having condemned it, do not despair of yourself, nor be like those ignoble people who, having once given in, surrender themselves completely and are swept away as if by a torrent. Rather, learn from the wrestling masters. The boy has fallen? 'Get up,' he says, 'and wrestle again until you are made strong.' You should experience something similar. For know that nothing is more tractable than the human soul. You need only to will it, and the thing is done; the correction is made. But nod off, and all is lost. For both ruin and salvation come from within. — 'What good, then, do I get?' — And what greater good are you looking for than this? You will be modest instead of shameless, orderly instead of disorderly, faithful instead of untrustworthy, self-controlled instead of dissolute. If you are looking for anything greater than these things, go right ahead and do what you are doing; for not even a god can save you now.",
    "notes": "Epictetus employs a powerful 'exchange rate' argument here: external power and wealth are purchased at the cost of internal peace and freedom. If one has 'nothing' (no virtue) to replace external lack, one is truly wretched; but the Sage realizes that 'not needing' is a superior asset to 'having.' The Discourse utilizes the famous 'fever analogy' to explain the pathology of desire (passions). Unlike a healthy thirst which is satisfied by water, a feverish thirst (desire) turns the object of desire into 'bile' (nausea/anxiety), creating a cycle of increasing dissatisfaction and sickness. Epictetus attacks the student's vanity—likely a student who has abandoned philosophy for the life of a fop or a seducer—contrasting the serious study of Stoic founders (Zeno, Chrysippus) with reading erotica (Aristeides). The core lesson is on the plasticity of the human will (prohairesis). Moral corruption is not permanent unless we allow it to be. The remedy is internal dialogue and 'wrestling'—getting back up immediately after a fall. The ultimate reward of Stoicism is not external gain, but the restoration of one's own character: becoming faithful, modest, and free.",

    "english": "Turn your mind to this: What things deserve our contempt, and over what things must we be vigilant? All human perplexity, all confusion, arises concerning external things. You hear people cry, 'What shall I do? How will it turn out? Let not this or that befall me!' These are the voices of men whose concern revolves around things outside the sphere of their own will. For who asks, 'How shall I not assent to what is false? How shall I not turn away from the truth?' If a man is naturally gifted enough to be anxious about these things, I will remind him: 'Why are you anxious? It is in your own power. Be at peace. Do not rush to assent before applying the rule of nature.' Again, if his anxiety concerns his desires—lest they fail—or his aversions—lest he fall into what he avoids—I will first embrace him, because he has cast aside the terrors that make others tremble and has focused his care on his own business, where his true self lies. Then I will say to him: 'If you would not fail in your desires or fall into what you avoid, desire nothing that belongs to others; avoid nothing that is not in your own control. If you do otherwise, you must necessarily fail and fall into disaster.' What room is there for perplexity here? What place is there for 'How will it turn out?' or 'I hope this doesn't happen'? Is not the outcome independent of your will? Yes. And is not the essence of good and evil in the sphere of your will? Yes. Is it not then in your power to make use of whatever happens in accordance with nature? Can anyone hinder you? No one. Then say no longer to me, 'How will it turn out?' For who would Hercules have been if he had said, 'I hope a great lion does not appear to me, or a great boar, or savage men?' If he had stayed at home wrapped in bedclothes, what would he have become? Certainly no Hercules. But since you must die regardless, you must necessarily be found doing something when death arrives—farming, perhaps, or digging, or trading, or serving as Consul, or suffering indigestion or dysentery. What, then, do you wish to be doing when death finds you? For my part, I wish to be found doing some work that belongs to a human being—beneficent, useful to the common good, noble. If I cannot be found doing such great things, I would at least be doing what none can hinder, what is given to me to do: correcting my own self, perfecting the faculty that makes use of impressions, laboring to achieve freedom from passion, and rendering what is due in my relationships. If I am this fortunate, death may find me reaching for the third topic—the security of my judgments. If death overtakes me in such a state, it is enough if I can lift up my hands to God and say: ' The faculties which I received from You to understand Your administration and to follow it, I have not neglected. I have not dishonored You as far as in me lay. See how I have used my perceptions; see how I have used my preconceptions. Have I ever blamed You? Have I been discontented with any event, or wished it otherwise? Have I transgressed my relationships? That You gave me life, I thank You for what You gave; so long as I have used what is Yours, it suffices me. Take them back again and place them where You will. For they were all Yours, and You gave them to me.' Is it not enough to leave the world in this state of mind? What life is better or more becoming than that of such a man? What end is more happy? But for this to happen, you must endure no small things, nor miss no small things. You cannot wish to be Consul and also wish for this; you cannot act to acquire lands and also this; you cannot worry about your slaves and also about yourself. If you want anything that belongs to others, what is your own is lost. This is the nature of the transaction: nothing is given for nothing. And what is strange in that? If you want to be Consul, you must keep awake, run about, kiss hands, rot at the doors of others, say and do many slavish things, send gifts to many, and daily presents to some. And what is the result? Twelve bundles of rods, to sit three or four times on the tribunal, to give games in the Circus, and to distribute baskets of food. Or let someone show me what else there is besides this. Will you then pay nothing for freedom from passion, for tranquility, for sleeping when you sleep, for being awake when you wake, for fearing nothing, for being anxious about nothing? But if anything belonging to you is lost while you are attending to these things, or is spent unprofitably, or another gets what you ought to have had, will you not immediately set against it what you acquire instead of it? How much for how much? Do you want to receive such great things for nothing? And how can you? One work against another. You cannot have external things well cared for and your own ruling faculty well cared for at the same time. If you want the former, let the latter go. If you do not, you will have neither the one nor the other, being distracted between both. 'The oil will be spilled, the grand furniture will perish, but I shall be free from passion.' 'There will be a fire when I am not there, and my books will be destroyed, but I shall use my impressions in accordance with nature.' 'But I shall have nothing to eat.' If I am so wretched, death is the harbor. That is the harbor of all, death; that is the refuge. For this reason, nothing in life is difficult. When you wish, you walk out, and you are not suffocated with smoke. Why then are you anxious? Why do you keep awake? Why do you not calculate where your good and evil lie, and say, 'Both are in my own power; no one can take the one from me, nor involve me in the other against my will'? Why then do I not snore at my ease? My own things are safe; what belongs to others, he will look to who bears them, however they may be given by Him who has the power. Who am I, to wish them to be so or so? Has a choice been given to me? Has anyone made me the administrator of them? It is enough for me that I have power over what belongs to me. This I must make as beautiful as possible; the rest must be as the Master of those things wills. Does a man who has these things before his eyes keep awake and turn from side to side? What does he wish, or what does he long for? Patroclus, or Antilochus, or Menelaus? For when did he think that any of his friends was immortal? When had he not before his eyes that on the morrow or the third day he or his friend must die? 'Yes, but I thought that he would survive me and bring up my son.' 'But he used to set food before me.' If the pot is broken in which your meat was cooked, must you die of hunger because you do not have your accustomed pot? Do you not send and buy another new one? He says: 'What do you think? Did not Homer compose these things on purpose, that we might see that the noblest, the strongest, the richest, the most beautiful, when they have not the dogmas which they ought to have, are not prevented from being most wretched and most unfortunate?'",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus presents the dichotomy of control as an economic transaction. He argues that anxiety ('What will happen?') is a symptom of misplaced value—caring for things not up to us. He uses the metaphors of Hercules and the political candidate to illustrate the cost of virtue. Hercules became Hercules only through adversity; the politician gains the Consulship only by selling his dignity. Epictetus demands we make a choice: we can 'buy' external success with our freedom, or we can 'buy' tranquility (apatheia) by sacrificing external attachments. He reframes death not as a catastrophe, but as a 'harbor' and a final accounting to God, where we return our borrowed faculties with gratitude. The reference to Achilles (mourning Patroclus) serves as a warning: even the greatest heroes are wretched if they lack correct judgments (dogmata) about mortality and the nature of the good.",

    "english": "Some raise a dispute as to whether the social instinct is included in the nature of man; yet these very same people would not, I think, dispute that cleanliness is certainly included in it, and that by this, if by nothing else, man is distinguished from the other animals. Accordingly, when we see any other animal cleaning itself, we are accustomed to speak with wonder and say that it is acting like a human being. On the other hand, if one condemns an animal for being dirty, we say instantly that it is, after all, not a human. Thus we suppose there is something superior about man which we first receive from the gods. For since the gods are by nature pure and uncorrupted, in so far as men have approached them by virtue of reason, they are to that extent naturally deeply attached to purity and cleanliness. But since it is impossible for their nature to be entirely pure, composed as it is of such corruptible stuff, reason is given to them to endeavor to make this material as clean as possible. The first and highest purity is that which is in the soul; and the same applies to impurity. Now, you could not find the impurity of the soul in a physical sense, as you would in the body; but as for the soul, what else could you find in it other than that which makes it filthy regarding its own functions? And the functions of the soul are to exercise impulse and repulsion, desire and aversion, preparation, design, and assent. What is it, then, that makes the soul filthy and unclean in these operations? It is nothing else but its own wicked judgments. Consequently, the impurity of the soul consists of bad opinions, and purification is the implantation of the right kind of opinions. And the soul is pure which has the right kind of opinions; for this soul alone is free from confusion and pollution in its own functions. Now one ought to endure to do something similar, as far as possible, for the body as well. It was impossible for the mucus of the nose not to flow so long as man has such a mixture of elements in his body; for this reason, Nature made hands and the nostrils themselves as channels to carry off the humors. If, then, a man sucks them up, I say that he is not performing the act of a human being. It was impossible for the feet not to be covered with mud and meant to be soiled when passing through such terrain; for this reason Nature prepared water and hands. It was impossible that some filth should not remain on the teeth after eating; for this reason, she says, wash your teeth. It was impossible that from sweat and the pressing of clothes, something dirty and requiring cleansing should not remain upon the body; for this reason we have water, oil, hands, towels, scrapers, soda, and all other such equipment to clean it. 'No,' you say. What? A smith acts as a smith—why? In order, I say to you, that you may act as a human being; and secondly, that you may not annoy those whom you meet. But you do something similar here to the smith who neglects his trade, and you do not perceive it. You think yourself worthy of smelling bad? Very well, be worthy of it! But do you think you are worthy to make those who sit by you smell it too? And those who recline at table with you? And those who kiss you? Go off into a desert somewhere, for that is what you are worthy of, and live there alone smelling of yourself. For it is only right that you alone should enjoy your own impurity. But when you are in a city, to behave so inconsiderately and foolishly, to whom do you think it appears good? If Nature had entrusted a horse to you, would you have overlooked it and left it untended? And now, think that your own body has been entrusted to you like a horse; wash it, wipe it off, make it so that no one will turn away from you, nor run away from you. But who does not turn away from a dirty man, one who smells, one who is foul-complexioned, more than from one who is bespattered with muck? The smell of the latter is external and accidental, but the smell of the former comes from lack of care and is from within, as if from a rotting thing. 'But Socrates rarely washed.' Yes, but his body was radiant; it was so gracious and agreeable that the most beautiful and noble men fell in love with him and desired to recline with him rather than with those who were physically most attractive. He had the right to neither wash nor bathe if he so pleased; yet even his 'rarely' had its effect. If you do not wish to wash with hot water, wash with cold. 'But Aristophanes says...' I tell you, all who have written about Socrates bear witness to exactly the opposite: that he was pleasant not only to hear but also to see. And they write the same regarding Diogenes. For one ought not to scare away the multitude from philosophy by the appearance of the body, but as in other things, a philosopher should show himself cheerful and unperturbed, so also in the body. 'See, men, that I have nothing, that I need nothing; see how, though I am homeless and stateless and an exile, if it so happens, and without a hearth, I live a more unperturbed and robust life than all the nobles and the rich. But look at my poor body, too, and see that it is not maltreated by my austere way of life.' But if one says this to me while wearing the face and figure of a condemned criminal, what god will persuade me to approach philosophy, which makes men like that? Heaven forbid! I would not do it, even if I were going to become a wise man. I, for my part, by the gods, would rather have the young man who is just beginning to be moved by philosophy come to me with his hair curled, than come with it shaggy and dirty. For in the former there is seen some faint notion of beauty and a desire for what is becoming; where he supposes it to be, there he applies his effort. It remains only to point it out to him and say: 'Young man, you are seeking the beautiful, and you do well. Know, then, that it grows in that part of you where you have your reason; seek it there where your impulses are, and your repulsions, where your desires and aversions are. For this implies a special prerogative which you have in yourself; but your poor body is by nature only clay. Why do you labor over it to no purpose? If for nothing else, you will learn by time that it is nothing.' But if a man comes to me all befouled, dirty, with a mustache down to his knees, what have I to say to him? By what resemblance can I lead him on? For what has he ever busied himself with that resembles the beautiful, so that I may change his direction and say, 'Beauty is not here, but there'? Do you want me to tell him, 'Beauty consists not in being befouled, but in reason'? For does he even have any desire for beauty? He shows signs of precisely the contrary. Therefore, the arguments of Xenocrates took hold of Polemo because he was a young man who loved beauty; for he entered having within him the sparks of a zeal for the beautiful, though he was looking for it in the wrong place. Nature has not made even the animals that live with men dirty. Does a horse wallow in the mire? Or a well-bred dog? No, but the hog does, and satisfy geese, and worms, and spiders—creatures that are banished furthest from human society. Will you, then, being a man, choose not to be even one of the animals that live with men, but rather a worm or a spider? Will you not wash yourself somewhere, as best you can? Will you not wash your clothes? Will you not come clean, so that those who are with you may take pleasure in you? But do you come even into the temples with us in such a state, where it is not lawful to spit or blow the nose, being yourself nothing but spittle and mucus? What then? Does anyone require you to beautify yourself? Heaven forbid! Except in that which is our true nature—the reason, the judgments, the actions; but as for the body, only so far as to be clean, so far as not to give offense. But if you are told that you must not wear scarlet, you go off and daub your cloak with muck, or tear it to pieces. 'But where can I get a fine cloak?' Man, you have water; wash it! Here is a young man worthy of being loved; here is an old man worthy of loving and being loved in return, one to whom a man would entrust his son, to be instructed by him. But as you are, who would approach you? Heaven forbid! Every deviation comes from something human; but this deviation of yours is close to being not human at all.",
    "notes": "In this lecture, Epictetus establishes the hierarchy of purity necessary for the Stoic life. The primary focus is the 'Inner Citadel': the purity of the soul (psychē), which is defined as the possession of correct judgments (dogmata) and the absence of vice. A dirty soul is one cluttered with false evaluations of external things. However, Epictetus strictly warns against the error of the 'False Cynic'—the student who mistakes philosophical simplicity for performative squalor. He argues that cleanliness (kathariotēs) is a natural, distinctively human trait mandated by our social nature (koinōnikon). Just as we care for a horse, we must care for the body as a tool given by Nature. To be physically repulsive is an act of arrogance and anti-social behavior, as it forces others to shun you, thereby cutting off the very social bonds a Stoic is meant to preserve. One cannot teach philosophy if one's appearance drives the student away. Therefore, basic hygiene is a duty to the community and a sign of respect for the divine gift of the human form.",

    "english": "On Attention. When you relax your attention for a short while, do not imagine that you will recover it whenever you please. Instead, keep this thought ready at hand: that because of today's error, your affairs must necessarily be in a worse condition henceforth. First, the habit of inattention—the hardest of all to break—installs itself, followed by the habit of deferring attention. If procrastination is beneficial, then total abandonment is even more so; but if it is not beneficial, why do you not maintain your attention continuously? 'I want to play today,' you say. Then play! 'I want to sing.' Then sing! But is anything in life done better by those who are not paying attention? Does the carpenter do his work better by being inattentive? Does the helmsman steer better by being inattentive? Do you not realize that once you let your mind loose, it is no longer in your power to recall it to propriety, to modesty, or to moderation? Instead, you do whatever comes into your head and follow your impulses. 'To what, then, must I pay attention?' First, to those universal principles which you must have always at hand: without them do not sleep, do not rise, do not drink, do not eat, do not interact with people. Realize that no one is master of another's moral choice, and that in this alone lie good and evil. No one, therefore, has the power to secure good for me, nor to involve me in evil; I alone have authority over myself in these matters. When, therefore, I am secure in these points, why am I still troubled about external things? What tyrant is to be feared, what disease, what poverty, what stumbling block? 'But I did not please so-and-so.' Is he my concern? Is he my judgment? No. 'Why, then, do I care?' 'But he seems to be someone of importance.' Let him look to that, and those who think so. But I have One whom I must please, to whom I must be subject, whom I must obey: God. And after Him, what is the cause of my disturbance? Nothing else than that in this matter I am untrained. Is it possible to be free from fault right now? It is impossible. But this is possible: to be constantly stretched toward not committing faults. For we must be content if, by never relaxing this attention, we escape at least a few errors. But now, when you say, 'I will pay attention tomorrow,' know that you are essentially saying, 'Today I will be shameless, untimely, and base; it shall be in the power of others to grieve me; today I will be angry and envious.' See how many evils you permit yourself! If it is good for you to attend tomorrow, how much better is it today? If it is profitable tomorrow, it is much more so today, so that you may be able to do so tomorrow as well, and not put it off again to the third day.",
    "notes": "This discourse defines 'Prosochē' (attention/mindfulness), the fundamental spiritual attitude of the practicing Stoic. It is a state of continuous, vigilant tension ('tonos') of the mind. Epictetus warns that character is cumulative; a moment of carelessness is not an isolated event but the seed of a habit that degrades the will. The specific object of this attention is not obsession with trivial details, but the constant application of the 'Universal Principles'—specifically the Dichotomy of Control (distinguishing between one's own moral choice and external events). Epictetus offers a pragmatic rejection of perfectionism: the goal is not to be instantly sinless (which is impossible for the non-Sage), but to maintain the constant 'stretch' or effort to avoid error. Finally, he attacks procrastination, arguing that delaying the practice of virtue is an active decision to remain vicious and vulnerable to suffering today.",

    "english": "Consider those who readily spill their own secrets. When someone appears to speak frankly to us about their private business, notice how we are lured into divulging our own secrets in return, thinking this is merely an act of candor. First, it seems unfair that they have shared their affairs while we do not share ours in turn. Second, we fear that by remaining silent we will appear secretive or untrustworthy. Indeed, they often say: 'I have told you everything about myself; are you unwilling to tell me anything of yours?' But where is the logic in this? There is also the false assumption that we can safely trust someone simply because they have already entrusted us with their secrets; we imagine they would never betray us for fear that we might betray them. This is exactly how the reckless are entrapped by soldiers in Rome. A soldier in civilian dress sits beside you and begins to speak ill of Caesar. You, treating his prior abuse of the Emperor as a pledge of his fidelity, speak your own mind. Then you are shackled and carried off. We suffer something similar in life. Just because he has safely entrusted his affairs to me, does not mean I can safely entrust mine to him. I listen and keep silent, for I am a man of discretion; but he goes out and blabs to everyone. If I am like him, I try to retaliate and reveal his secrets, bringing ruin upon us both. If I remember that one man cannot truly harm another—but that each man is harmed or helped by his own actions—I refrain from acting like him, though I still suffer the consequences of my own loose tongue. 'But it is unfair,' you say, 'to hear his secrets and share nothing in return.' Did I ask you to speak, man? Did you reveal your affairs on the condition that I would reveal mine? If you are a blabbermouth who mistakes every stranger for a friend, do you want me to become like you? Suppose I have a watertight vessel, and yours is full of holes. You come and deposit your wine with me to store in my jar, and then you fall into a rage because I will not entrust my wine to you? Your vessel is perforated! How can there be equality here? You entrusted your affairs to a faithful man, a man of shame and honor, who believes that only his own actions can harm or help him, and that external things are nothing. Do you want me to entrust my affairs to you—a man who has dishonored his own will, who creates a market for his loyalty, who would sell me out for a little coin, or an office, or a promotion at court? A man who would kill his own children, like Medea, for his passions? Where is the fairness in this? Show me that you are faithful, honorable, and steady; show me you hold friendly principles; show me that your vessel has no holes, and you will see that I will not wait for you to trust me, but I myself will come to you and beg you to hear my own affairs. For who does not wish to use a sound vessel? Who despises a loyal and benevolent counselor? Who would not gladly welcome someone to share the burden of his circumstances? 'But I trust you, and you do not trust me,' you complain. First of all, you do not trust me; you are simply a chatterbox unable to hold your tongue. If you truly trusted me, you would trust me alone; but now, you sit next to the first idle man you see and say, 'Brother, I have no one who wishes me well but you,' and then proceed to tell him everything. To be a keeper of secrets requires character and specific judgments. If you see a man devoted to things outside his own will—submitting his moral purpose to them—know that this man has ten thousand masters who can compel him. He needs no torture wheel to make him spill what he knows; a mere nod from a pretty girl will shake it out of him, or a favor from a courtier, or the lust for office or inheritance. Remember this general rule: secrets require fidelity and stable judgments. Where can we easily find these now? Show me the man who says: 'I care only for what is my own, what is unhindered, what is free by nature. This is the essence of the good; let all else happen as it may, it makes no difference to me.'",
    "notes": "In this discourse, Epictetus warns against the social trap of reciprocity in conversation. We often feel compelled to share our secrets simply because someone has shared theirs, mistaking their lack of inhibition for 'trust' or 'friendship.' Epictetus clarifies that true trust is not a transaction ('I told you, now you tell me'), but a recognition of character. A person whose 'vessel' is leaky—meaning they lack self-control or discretion—cannot be trusted, no matter how much they like you. Furthermore, Epictetus provides the ultimate criterion for a trustworthy confidant: someone who values their 'Prohairesis' (moral will) above all external things. If a person values money, status, or pleasure (externals), they are vulnerable to leverage; anyone who controls those externals controls that person's tongue. Therefore, the Stoic keeps their own counsel not out of fear, but out of wisdom, only sharing their inner thoughts with those who have demonstrated that their happiness depends solely on their own integrity, making them incorruptible.",
