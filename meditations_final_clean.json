The specific virtues highlighted are 'aidos' (a sense of shame, propriety, or respect for the social bond) and manly strength.

    "notes": "This chapter acknowledges Q. Junius Rusticus, the man responsible for turning Marcus away from empty rhetoric (mere speech-making) toward the rigorous practice of Stoic philosophy. The central theme is that philosophy is a medical treatment ('therapeia') for the soul, not a performance for applause. Rusticus taught Marcus to avoid ostentation in his asceticism—performing virtuous acts or living simply should be done for its own sake, not to show off 'drastic' behavior. The mention of Epictetus is historically significant; Rusticus provided Marcus with his personal copy of Epictetus's 'Discourses', establishing the direct lineage of Marcus's thought regarding the dichotomy of control and the discipline of assent. The advice to 'read with precision' underscores the Stoic commitment to deep, internalized understanding ('katalepsis') over superficial knowledge.",

The reference to the 'loss of a child' is deeply personal, as Marcus lost many children, yet emphasizes the Stoic discipline of maintaining a consistent character guided by reason despite external tragedies. This chapter highlights the balance of the soul's tension—being 'resolute yet relaxed'—and prioritizes lived virtue over mere technical skill in teaching philosophy.

    "english": "From my father: gentleness, and an unshakeable adherence to judgments formed after thorough examination; and no vanity regarding what are popularly deemed honors; and love of work and persistence; and a willingness to listen to those who have something to contribute to the common good; and the unswerving practice of assigning to everyone what is due according to their worth; and the experience of knowing where to tighten the reins and where to relax them. \n\nI observed his prohibition of pederasty; his sociability, and how he released his friends from the necessity of dining with him or traveling with him, so that those who had been left behind due to some obligation always found him the same upon their return. I noted his searching inquiry in council meetings, and his tenacity—never accepting the first impression and stopping the investigation prematurely. I learned from his consistency in friendship, neither quickly tiring of people nor becoming obsessively attached; his self-sufficiency in all things and his cheerful demeanor; his foresight regarding the future, managing even the smallest details without theatrical drama.\n\nHe checked public acclamations and all forms of flattery; he was a watchful guardian of the empire's necessities, stewarding its resources and enduring the criticism that came from such thrift. Regarding the gods, he was not superstitious; regarding men, he was no demagogue, neither courting the mob nor pandering to them, but sober in all things, steady, and never lacking in taste or chasing novelty. He used the comforts of life—which fortune provided in abundance—without arrogance and without apology, so that he enjoyed them naturally when they were present but did not miss them when they were absent.\n\nNo one would ever call him a sophist, a buffoon, or a pedant, but rather a man who was ripe, complete, above flattery, and capable of presiding over his own affairs and those of others. Add to this his honor for true philosophers—without reviling the others or being misled by them; his affability and grace in conversation, without excess. He took reasonable care of his body, not as one clinging to life or vain about his appearance, nor yet negligently, but enough so that, through his own attention, he rarely needed medical aid or salves.\n\nMost notably, he yielded without envy to those possessing specific skills—whether in expression, knowledge of laws and customs, or other matters—and he actively helped them gain the reputation their specific merits deserved. He acted according to ancestral custom without ever making a display of preserving tradition. He was not fickle or restless, but fond of staying in the same places and pursuits. immediately after severe headaches, he returned fresh and vigorous to his usual tasks. He kept very few secrets, and those only regarding matters of state.\n\nHe showed prudence and measure in the organization of spectacles, construction projects, and distributions, looking always to what needed to be done rather than the glory of the doing. He did not bathe at odd hours, was not obsessed with building, was not critical of food, the weave of clothes, or the beauty of servants. His manner of dress from Lorium, his tunic from Lanuvium, and how he handled the tax collector at Tusculum—these details speak to his character.\n\nThere was nothing harsh, relentless, or violent about him, nothing that would make one say 'he is sweating with effort'; rather, everything was reasoned out as if at leisure—calmly, methodically, vigorously, and consistently. One could apply to him what is recorded of Socrates: that he was able both to abstain from and to enjoy those things which many are too weak to abstain from and too intemperate to enjoy. But to possess the strength, the endurance, and the sobriety for both states belongs to a man who has a perfect and invincible soul, as was shown during the illness of Maximus.",
    "notes": "This chapter is the longest and most significant tribute in Book 1, dedicated to Antoninus Pius, Marcus's adoptive father. It serves as a practical portrait of the 'Stoic Sage' in the role of a ruler. The notes emphasize several core Stoic virtues: \n\n1) **Rationality over Impression:** Antoninus does not act on 'phantasia' (first impressions) but investigates thoroughly ('akribōs'). \n\n2) **Preferred Indifferents:** His attitude toward luxury is the textbook Stoic ideal—he uses wealth when available without attachment or arrogance ('atyphōs'), and lets it go without distress when absent. \n\n3) **Justice and Common Good:** He focuses on what is 'common-beneficial' (koinōpheles) and distributes resources according to merit ('kat' axian'). \n\n4) **Simplicity and Aversion to Vanity:** He avoids 'kenodoxia' (empty glory/vanity), rejects flattery, and handles duties without 'drama' ('atragōdōs'). \n\n5) **The Socratic Ideal:** The explicit comparison to Socrates highlights the virtue of temperance—the self-control to manage both pleasure and pain with a balanced, 'invincible' soul.",

    "english": "From the gods: to have good grandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good teachers, good associates, relatives, and friends—almost all of them. And that I did not stumble into offending any of them, even though I had the sort of disposition that might have led me to do so if the occasion had arisen; it was the benevolence of the gods that no chain of events occurred to expose me. That I was not brought up for too long with my grandfather's concubine, and that I preserved my youth, and did not become a man before the proper time, but even held back a little. To have been subjected to a ruler and a father who was destined to strip me of all vanity and lead me to the realization that it is possible to live in a palace without wanting guards, embroidered robes, torches, statues, and such pomp; but that one can constrict oneself very close to the station of a private citizen without thereby being more abject or remiss regarding the duties that must be performed mainly for the common good. To have happened upon such a brother, capable by his character of rousing me to care for myself, while at the same time gladdening me with respect and affection; that my children were neither naturally ungifted nor physically deformed. That I did not make too much progress in rhetoric, poetry, and other pursuits in which I might have been held fast had I felt myself advancing smoothly. That I hurried to place my tutors in the stations of honor they seemed to desire, and did not put them off with the hope that, since they were still young, I would do it later. To have known Apollonius, Rusticus, Maximus. To have envisioned clearly and often what the life according to nature is like, so that, as far as it depends on the gods and their communications, assistance, and inspirations, nothing prevents me now from living according to nature, except my own fault and my failure to observe the reminders—and almost the instructions—from the gods. That my body has held out so long in such a life; that I did not touch Benedicta or Theodotus, and that later, even when falling into love-sickness, I was cured. That though I was often angry with Rusticus, I did nothing for which I would have repented; that my mother, though destined to die young, spent her last years with me. That whenever I wished to help someone in poverty or in need of anything else, I was never told that I had no money for it; and that I did not fall into a similar need myself to take from another. That my wife is as she is: so obedient, so affectionate, so simple. That I had an abundance of good tutors for my children. That help was given to me through dreams, particularly regarding how not to spit up blood and not to feel giddy... and that when I desired philosophy, I did not fall into the hands of a sophist, nor sit writing treatises, nor analyzing syllogisms, nor becoming absorbed in meteorological speculation. For all these things require the help of the gods and fortune. Written among the Quadi, by the Granua.",
    "notes": "This concluding chapter of Book 1 is a comprehensive hymn of gratitude, demonstrating the Stoic virtue of acknowledging the role of Providence (pronoia) and external fate in shaping one's character. Marcus does not take credit for his own virtues; rather, he attributes them to the influence of family, mentors, and the gods. Key Stoic themes include: 1) The rejection of 'typhos' (pomp/vanity), learned from Antoninus Pius, emphasizing that a Stoic sage can remain simple even in a palace. 2) The concept of 'life according to nature,' which he admits he has been given every opportunity to understand, placing the blame for any moral failings strictly on himself (a recognition that while circumstances are not 'up to us,' our assent to them is). 3) Sexual temperance and control over anger, viewed here as crucial victories of the rational mind over the passions. 4) The dismissal of sophistry, logic-chopping, and physical speculation (meteorology) in favor of practical ethics. The final tag locates the writing geographically on the Danube frontier, highlighting that these reflections on gratitude and peace were composed in the midst of a brutal war.",

The core admonition is against procrastination: time is a finite resource circumscribed by fate, and failing to use it to purify the ruling faculty results in the permanent loss of opportunity.",

He introduces the practice of 'memento mori' not to induce fear, but to ensure authenticity and eliminate trivial worries.

For the angry man seems to turn away from reason with a certain pain and unconscious contraction; whereas the man who sins through desire, defeated by pleasure, appears somewhat more intemperate and softer in his wrongdoing. Rightly then, and in a manner worthy of philosophy, he said that the act attended by pleasure is more blameworthy than the one attended by pain. In general, the one looks more like a man who has been wronged first and is compelled by pain to get angry; the other starts out to do wrong on his own, rushed into action by desire.",
    "notes": "Marcus refers to Theophrastus, a Peripatetic philosopher, to make a nuanced distinction in moral psychology between anger and desire. While orthodox Stoicism often treats all errors as equal deviations from reason, this practical observation suggests that sins of desire are worse because they involve an active pursuit of pleasure and a surrender of the will, characterizing a 'softer' or less resilient soul. Anger, by contrast, is a reactive response to pain or perceived injustice, involving an internal struggle or contraction. The passage highlights the importance of examining the motivation behind actions and the specific movement of the soul—whether it is shrinking away in pain or rushing forward in lust.",

And if there are no gods, or if they have no regard for human affairs, why should I live in a world without gods or without providence? But they do exist, and they do care for humanity. They have put it entirely in a man’s power to avoid falling into true evils. If there were any evil in the rest of experience, they would have provided for us to avoid that too. But if something does not make a human being worse, how could it make his life worse? Universal nature would not have overlooked this through ignorance, nor—though knowing it—failed to prevent or correct it through lack of power or skill. It would not have made such a mistake, due to inability or incompetence, as to let good and evil things happen indiscriminately to good and bad men alike. But death and life, success and failure, pain and pleasure, wealth and poverty, all these happen equally to the good and the bad; they are neither noble nor shameful, and therefore they are neither good nor evil.",
    "notes": "This passage is a foundational text for Stoic ethics and theodicy. It begins with the exercise of memento mori—using the inevitability of death not to induce fear, but to clarify immediate moral purpose. Marcus then logically dismantles the fear of death through the 'providence or atoms' dichotomy: either the universe is ruled by benevolent gods (who would not allow a true evil like death to harm a good person), or it is chaos (in which case, life is meaningless anyway). He concludes with the definitive Stoic stance on 'indifferents' (adiaphora). He argues that because 'universal nature' is just, and because external things (pain, death, poverty) happen to both virtuous and vicious people, these things cannot be inherently 'good' or 'evil.' Only moral character is good or evil; everything else is merely the material upon which we act.",

And reverence of it consists in keeping it pure from passion and aimlessness, and from dissatisfaction with what comes from gods and men. For the things from the gods are venerable for their excellence, and the things from men are dear for their kinship; and sometimes they are even, in a way, objects of pity because of their ignorance of good and evil—a disability not less than that which deprives us of the power to distinguish between white and black.",

Since we only possess the present, death can only deprive us of that single, fleeting instant, regardless of how long we have lived. Mathematically, the loss is identical for a centenarian and a child. Furthermore, he invokes the Stoic cosmological view of eternal recurrence—that the universe cyclically repeats the same patterns and archetypes. Therefore, living longer does not grant access to new realities, only the repetition of the same ones.",

He acknowledges that while objective reality exists, human experience is entirely shaped by internal judgments.

Secondly, when it turns away from any human being, or is carried against him to do him harm, such as are the souls of those who are angry. Thirdly, when it is overcome by pleasure or pain. Fourthly, when it plays a part, doing or saying anything insincerely and falsely. Fifthly, when it allows any action or impulse of its own to be without an aim, and does anything thoughtlessly and without consequence, whereas even the smallest things ought to be referred to an end; and the end of rational animals is to follow the reason and the law of the most ancient city and government.",
    "notes": "In this passage, Aurelius outlines five distinct ways the ruling faculty (hegemonikon) commits violence against itself. The first is a rejection of providence; by resenting what happens, one separates oneself from the web of cause and effect, becoming a 'tumor' on the cosmic body. The second is anger, which violates the Stoic requirement for social coherence and fellowship. The third is surrendering self-control to bodily sensations. The fourth is hypocrisy, which offends the truth of the logos. The final error is acting without a target or purpose (telos). For a Stoic, even the smallest action must align with the universal law of the 'ancient city'—the cosmopolis governed by nature.",

    "english": "Of human life the duration is a point, the substance is in flux, the perception dim, the composition of the whole body prone to decay, the soul a whirl, fortune hard to divine, and fame a matter of uncritical judgment. In a word, everything of the body is a river, and everything of the soul is a dream and vapor; life is a warfare and a stranger's sojourn, and after-fame is oblivion. What then is capable of escorting us? One thing and one thing only: philosophy. This consists in keeping the inner spirit within us free from violence and unharmed, superior to pleasures and pains, doing nothing aimlessly nor falsely and with hypocrisy, independent of what another does or fails to do. Furthermore, it involves accepting what happens and what is allotted as coming from that source, wherever it is, from which one came oneself; and above all, waiting for death with a cheerful mind, regarding it as nothing else than a dissolution of the elements of which every living creature is composed. But if there is nothing terrible for the elements themselves in each of them continuously changing into another, why should one view the change and dissolution of all things with suspicion? For it is in accordance with nature, and nothing evil is in accordance with nature. Written at Carnuntum.",
    "notes": "This famous chapter serves as a comprehensive summary of Stoic physics and ethics. Marcus begins with a Heraclitean view of the physical world, emphasizing the transience of time ('a point') and the constant flux of matter ('a river'). He contrasts this impermanence with the only stable refuge: philosophy, defined here not as academic study, but as the guardianship of the 'daemon' or inner spirit (the ruling faculty of reason). The passage outlines the three Stoic disciplines: the discipline of desire (accepting fate and nature), the discipline of action (acting with purpose and social responsibility), and the discipline of assent (viewing external impressions, like death, objectively). By reducing death to the mere 'dissolution of elements,' he strips it of terror, arguing that because it is a natural process ordained by universal reason, it cannot be evil. The subscription 'Written at Carnuntum' places this reflection on the Danube frontier during the Marcomannic Wars, contextualizing his description of life as 'warfare and a stranger's sojourn'.",

For if he begins to sink into senility, breathing and feeding and imagining and impulse and all such things will not be lacking; but the power to make use of oneself, to be exact about the measures of duty, to articulate impressions, to evaluate whether one should now walk out of life, and all such things that require a thoroughly trained reasoning faculty—these are extinguished beforehand. We must therefore make haste, not only because we are drawing closer to death at every moment, but also because our grasp of things and our ability to follow them cease before we do.",

While basic animal functions like nutrition and impulse persist, the complex cognitive abilities required for virtue—such as analyzing impressions, performing appropriate acts (*kathekonta*), and even making the difficult ethical calculation of 'reasonable departure' (suicide)—may fade due to age.

    "english": "We must also observe this: that even the secondary effects of nature's works have something charming and captivating about them. Take, for instance, a loaf of bread: when it bakes, certain parts crack open. Now, these cracks—though in a way contrary to the baker's profession—are somehow handsome and stimulate our appetite in a unique way. Or figs: when they are fully ripe, they burst open. And in olives left on the tree, the very proximity of decay adds a particular beauty to the fruit. The drooping heads of grain, the lion's scowling brow, the foam dripping from the boar's snout, and many other things—if viewed in isolation, they are far from beautiful. Yet, because they follow naturally from processes that are nature's own, they contribute to the ornament of the whole and cheer the spirit. Therefore, if a person has developed a sensibility and a deeper insight regarding the things happening in the universe, hardly any of these secondary consequences will fail to appear pleasing to him in their specific arrangement. He will look upon the actual gaping jaws of wild beasts with no less pleasure than the representations shown by painters and sculptors. He will be able to see a kind of bloom and prime in old women and old men, and he will look upon the charm of children with chaste eyes. Many such things will present themselves, persuasive not to everyone, but only to the one who is genuinely intimate with nature and her works.",
    "notes": "This chapter explores the Stoic concept of 'epiginomena'—incidental consequences or byproducts of nature's primary intent. Marcus argues that because the universe (Nature/Logos) is rational and good, even the unintended side effects of its processes possess a distinct beauty if viewed with the correct understanding. He challenges conventional aesthetics by finding beauty in the 'scowling brow' of a lion or the 'decay' of a ripe olive, suggesting that a wise person appreciates reality as it is, rather than through idealistic or artistic filters. This reflects the Stoic practice of 'oikeiosis' (appropriation or familiarity), where one feels at home in the cosmos, accepting the full cycle of life—including aging and death—as a harmonious part of the whole. The reference to 'chaste eyes' underscores the Stoic discipline of assent, allowing one to appreciate beauty without being carried away by irrational lust.",

Heraclitus, who speculated so much about the world's conflagration, was filled with water inside and died smeared with dung. Vermin killed Democritus; other vermin killed Socrates. What does this mean? You embarked, you sailed, you have docked: disembark. If it is to another life, nothing is empty of gods, even there.

Marcus employs a catalogue of great figures to demonstrate that the physical end is inescapable regardless of one's station or achievements. The nautical metaphor ('embarked, sailed, docked') strips death of its terror, framing it as a natural conclusion to a journey. Finally, he engages in a standard Stoic dichotomy regarding the afterlife: it is either a transition to a divinely ordered existence or a release from sensation. In either case, it is not to be feared, especially as it frees the divine aspect of the self (the mind) from its servitude to the mixture of earth and gore that is the body.",

    "english": "Do not waste what remains of your life in speculations about others, unless you are referring your thoughts to some common good. For you deprive yourself of other work when you ponder what such a person is doing, and why, and what they are saying, thinking, and plotting, and all such things that distract you from the observation of your own ruling faculty. You must therefore check the aimless and idle in the flow of your thoughts, and even more so the meddlesome and malicious. You must habituate yourself to thinking only those thoughts about which, if someone were suddenly to ask, \"What are you thinking now?\" you could answer immediately and with frankness, \"This and that.\" From these answers, it would be instantly clear that all is simple and benevolent, befitting a social animal who disregards images of pleasure or indulgence, rivalry, envy, suspicion, or anything else you would blush to admit was in your mind.\n\nSuch a man, who no longer postpones being among the best, is like a priest and minister of the gods. He utilizes the divinity situated within him, which renders the man unsoiled by pleasures, unwounded by any pain, untouched by insult, insensible to all wickedness, a wrestler in the greatest contest of all—never to be thrown by any passion—dyed deep in justice, welcoming with his whole soul all that happens and is allotted to him. He does not often, nor without great necessity for the common good, speculate on what another says or does or thinks. For he carries out only his own business and continually contemplates the lot spun for him out of the whole; he ensures his own actions are beautiful and is persuaded that his own lot is good. For the fate assigned to each is carried along with him and carries him along.\n\nHe remembers, too, that all rational beings are akin, and that while caring for all humans accords with human nature, one must not hold to the opinion of all, but only of those who live in agreement with nature. As for those who do not live thus, he constantly keeps in mind what sort of people they are at home and abroad, by night and by day, and with whom they mingle. Consequently, he does not value praise from such men, who do not even please themselves.",
    "notes": "This chapter is a foundational text on Stoic mental discipline, specifically focusing on the 'ruling faculty' (hegemonikon) and the proper use of impressions. Marcus admonishes himself against mental wandering and gossip, viewing attention to the minds of others—when not for the common good—as a dereliction of one's own moral duty. The core instruction is to cultivate a transparency of mind where one's inner monologue is so virtuous and simple that it could be broadcast publicly without shame. The text introduces the metaphor of the Stoic practitioner as a 'priest' of the inner divinity (daimon), emphasizing self-sufficiency, indifference to pain and pleasure, and a deep acceptance of fate (amor fati). It concludes by reconciling the social duty to care for all humanity with the intellectual independence to disregard the opinions of those who do not live according to nature.",

Marcus lists four vices to avoid in action: reluctance (acting against nature), unsocial behavior (acting against the common good), thoughtlessness, and inner conflict. He emphasizes the role of the inner daemon—the divine spark of reason—as the guardian of one's specific social and political roles (Roman, ruler, citizen). The text culminates in the concept of spiritual self-sufficiency (autarkeia); a Stoic must possess intrinsic rectitude ('being upright') rather than relying on the external props of reputation, oaths, or the validation of others ('being kept upright').",

    "english": "If you discover anything in human life better than justice, truth, temperance, and courage—in short, a mind satisfied with itself in those things where it acts according to right reason, and satisfied with destiny in those things assigned to it without its choice; if, I say, you see anything better than this indwelling spirit which has subjected your individual impulses to itself, examined your impressions, withdrawn itself from the passions of the senses (as Socrates used to say), submitted itself to the gods, and cares for mankind; if you find everything else smaller and cheaper than this, then give place to nothing else. For if you once incline and turn towards that other thing, you will no longer be able to honor that good which is properly your own without distraction. It is not lawful for anything of a different nature—like the praise of the many, or power, or wealth, or the enjoyment of pleasure—to be set alongside the rational and political good. All these things, even if they seem to fit for a moment, suddenly take control and sweep you away. But you, I say, simply and freely choose the better and hold fast to it. 'But the advantageous is the better.' If it is advantageous to you as a rational being, keep it; but if it is only advantageous to you as an animal, renounce it, and maintain your judgment without arrogance; only see that you make your inquiry securely.",
    "notes": "This pivotal chapter presents the ultimate Stoic ultimatum: the choice between Virtue (the four cardinal virtues: justice, truth/wisdom, temperance, courage) and 'Indifferents' (wealth, pleasure, fame). Marcus argues that the 'daemon' (the inner guiding reason or divinity) provides a self-sufficiency that external goods cannot match. He warns that moral goods and external goods are 'heterogeneous'—of different natures—and cannot be balanced against one another; prioritizing externals inevitably enslaves the mind. The reference to Socrates alludes to the intellect's ability to remain unaffected by sensory input. The final distinction defines 'advantageous' (sympheron) strictly: only that which serves the rational, social nature is truly advantageous, whereas that which serves the mere biological ('animal') nature is secondary and must be viewed with detachment.",

And the greatest thing: he will live without pursuing or fleeing. He does not care a whit whether he will use the soul enclosed in his body for a longer or a shorter span of time; for even if he must depart immediately, he goes as easily as he would to do any other deed that can be done with self-respect and order, being careful of this one thing throughout his whole life: that his mind should not fall into any state inappropriate to a rational and social being.",

He argues that if a perceived advantage requires secrecy (walls and curtains), hypocrisy, or malice, it destroys one's character and is therefore a harm, not a benefit. The reference to 'walls and curtains' suggests that vice seeks concealment, whereas virtue is open and needs no hiding place. The passage also touches on the Stoic discipline of desire—living without 'pursuing or fleeing' things outside one's control. Finally, it reinforces the indifference to the duration of life; the philosopher is ready to return the soul to the cosmos at any moment, viewing death simply as another natural act to be performed with dignity.",

By defining life as strictly 'the present moment' (the past is gone, the future is uncertain), he isolates the only domain where virtue and choice can be exercised. The dismissal of fame is based on the impermanence of the observers; seeking validation from future generations is futile because they are as transient and ignorant as the current one.

For nothing is so productive of greatness of mind as the ability to examine systematically and truthfully every object that presents itself in life, and always to look at things so as to understand what utility this thing provides to what kind of universe, what value it has in relation to the whole, and what in relation to man—a citizen of that highest city, of which the other cities are like mere households. Ask: what is this thing that is now creating an impression in me? Of what is it composed? How long is it essentially designed to last? And of what virtue is there need in dealing with it—such as gentleness, courage, truth, simplicity, self-sufficiency, and the rest? Therefore, on every occasion one must say: this comes from God; this comes from the allotment and the spun thread and similar coincidence and chance; and this comes from one of my own tribe and kin and fellowship, who is, however, ignorant of what is according to nature for him. But I am not ignorant; therefore I treat him according to the natural law of fellowship, benevolently and justly; at the same time, however, regarding things indifferent, I aim to value them according to their worth.",
    "notes": "This chapter outlines a crucial Stoic exercise often called 'physical definition' or 'objective description.' Marcus instructs himself to strip away subjective value judgments and emotional coloring from an event or object to see it 'naked' (its material substance and temporary nature). This analysis serves three purposes: 1) It reduces being overwhelmed by an impression by breaking it into manageable parts; 2) It locates the event within the cosmic city (Cosmopolitanism), determining its function in the larger whole; and 3) It categorizes the source of the event. Marcus distinguishes three sources: Providence (God), Fate (mechanical causality/chance), and human agency. While he must treat ignorant humans with kindness because they are kin who err involuntarily, he must simultaneously maintain his own rational judgment regarding 'things indifferent' (adiaphora)—external things like wealth or status that are neither virtues nor vices.",

The reference to the 'inner spirit' (daimon) reflects the belief that reason is a divine fragment within the human, to be kept pure as a loan from the cosmos.
